<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
