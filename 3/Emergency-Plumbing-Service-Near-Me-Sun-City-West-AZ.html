<p>The U-shaped pipe below bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people anticipate to see however rarely stop to consider. Another extremely important reason to call a professional for gas line repair in Richmond is the risk of fire it presents.

There are 2 different kinds of testable backflow prevention devices that are commonly specified-- a minimized pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
