<p>In the 1990 ′ s, drought conditions motivated water companies to execute water preservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet components in residences were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush models.

For that reason when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
