<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a viable service, particularly when basic plunging does not seem to work. However, there are numerous downsides to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they generally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your home and family.</p>

<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Jackson MI 49201</h3>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
