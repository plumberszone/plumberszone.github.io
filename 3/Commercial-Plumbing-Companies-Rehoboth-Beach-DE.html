<p>This article aims to address the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: an effectively configured water softener does not make the cured water more corrosive. Here are a few complicated facts that often lead people to this erroneous conclusion. First, naturally soft water is typically corrosive. For that reason, softened water must also be corrosive, right? This is a fallacy due to the fact that naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>
