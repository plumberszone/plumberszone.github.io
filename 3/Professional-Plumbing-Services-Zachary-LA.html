Water hardness, measured by the grains per gallon (gpg) of magnesium and calcium in the water, differs across the U.S. from somewhat hard (<3 gpg) to very hard (>14 gpg).</p>

<p>Hard water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>It's a strangely complicated scientific procedure, but simple to fix. It uses salt to remove odors and minerals found in hard water- most typically calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems utilize resin beads that attach and bring in sodium ions in the softener tank. Pumps push difficult water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
