<p>Hard water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals.

Pumps push difficult water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
