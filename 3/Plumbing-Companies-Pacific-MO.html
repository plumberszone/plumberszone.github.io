<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
