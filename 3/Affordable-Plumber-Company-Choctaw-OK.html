<p>Metal alloys are vulnerable to an electro-chemical condition called deterioration. Deterioration can literally consume a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it originally was or modify the tolerances triggering parts to not operate in a backflow preventer. If the part is functional or must be changed, the impact of rust on a metal alloy should be assessed to identify.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits collect, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits occur more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you wish to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
