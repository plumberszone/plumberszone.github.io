<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>

<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if essential. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may have to increase or decrease the vent size to make sure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Lots of people are reluctant to use water softening systems because they may be under the impression that the equipment regenerates rather often and puts a high load of salt salts into the waste water.
