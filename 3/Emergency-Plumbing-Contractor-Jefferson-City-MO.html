<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return because he had another visit. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>A Water Softener is a filtration system that works to eliminate high concentrations of calcium and magnesium that cause difficult water. The system filters out these hard water minerals and the softened water then leaves the water softening system to flow through plumbing when water flows through a Water Softener. State certified backflow professionals, available through your turf watering company or plumber can determine whether or not your equipment satisfies the requirements. The guidelines likewise require a state certified backflow service technician test the backflow preventer annually.</p>

The backflow prevention assembly should be dismantled and parts changed with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly should be evaluated again to be sure it was properly repaired. Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flow chart is essential to ensure it was repaired appropriately.
