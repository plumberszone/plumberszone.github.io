<p>Then attach the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if appropriate). If your unit is outlet-ready-- take note of this part-- make certain your disposal switch is in the off" position before you plug the brand-new unit in. While it's not likely that having a disposal start up while your head is pressed against it will lead to decapitation, it might scare a couple of years off your life. Not that I would understand from experience.</p>

<p>Physical strength. Pipefitters, plumbers, and steamfitters must be able to lift and move heavy tools and products. Suggestion: Location a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen up the clamp and get rid of the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Trying to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are degrading slowly from the within. In most cases, repiping is your only practical choice.</p>
