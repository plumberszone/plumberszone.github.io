<p>Have actually utilized Plumb Crazy on three different events, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our professionals and they were great. They rapidly found the leak and repaired it without making a big mess. They, as with everyone we have actually encountered with Plumb Crazy, were courteous, timely, and very well-informed. I would advise Plumb Crazy to anybody requiring either big or little task plumbing work.</p>
