<p>This short article intends to resolve the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes deterioration This is not the case: a properly configured water softener does not make the cured water more destructive. Here are a few complicated realities that frequently lead people to this erroneous conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is generally corrosive.

<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Brevard NC 28712</h3>
<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive.
