<p>Backflow preventers are also needed by the plumbing code.

When it comes to backflow preventer requirements, Seattle Public Utilities works with both King County plumbing and the City of Shoreline.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
