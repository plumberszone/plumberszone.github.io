<p>Hard water use may impact the efficiency of household appliances. When warmed, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the hot water heater. A large scale buildup slows the heating procedure and requires more energy to heat water. Water heaters with large build-ups of mineral buildup will have a much shorter life expectancy. Scale deposits also build up to plug plumbing fixtures and develop in other devices such as coffee pots and dishwashing machines, therefore impacting their performance.</p>
<p>Galvanized piping is responsible for at least half of the plumbing emergencies that we encounter in your homes around the Bay Area.
