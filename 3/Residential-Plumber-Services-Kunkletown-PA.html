<p>Check to ensure it's not your garbage disposal that's causing the issue. A clogged disposal can stop up the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then inspect it to ensure it's running correctly. You may need to turn the switch discovered on the side or bottom of the system beneath the sink if the disposal has overheated.</p>
<h3>Gas Water Heater Repair in Kunkletown Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>If you have a waste disposal unit, you can try discarding a tray of ice down the drain, and after that turn on the waste disposal unit while running water.
