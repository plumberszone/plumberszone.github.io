<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Rather than removing the obstruction with unfavorable pressure, it actually pushes into the blockage, working further into where the blockage is taking place.

The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps force it further down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>

If this heater is installed in a house with multiple restrooms, the piping process adds to the installation expenses.</p>
