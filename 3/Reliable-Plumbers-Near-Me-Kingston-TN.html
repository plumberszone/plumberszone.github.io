<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned if you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>
