<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
<p>A Pilot Light That Has Actually Gone Out: If you are not getting any warm water at all, and you use a gas water heater instead of a system with an electrical heating element, there is a good chance your pilot light has actually gone out. This could be because of a problem with your thermocouple, an absence of combustible air, or simply a strong breeze. Despite what the problem is, however, your hot water heater will not have the ability to operate till the pilot burner is re-lit.</p>
