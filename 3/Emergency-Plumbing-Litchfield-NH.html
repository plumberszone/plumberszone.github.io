<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing stoppage service may look like a waste of money. Why purchase professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will suffice? While chemical drain cleaners might be an affordable service, the harsh ingredients rust your inner drain pipe, in time, creating vulnerable points in the pipe that are most likely to burst. Dealing with repairing a burst pipe is definitely not worth the savings sustained from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>Examine the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and turn on the disposal to make sure it works. Examine underneath to be sure there aren't any leakages.
