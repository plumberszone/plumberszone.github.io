<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Williamston MI</h3>
<p>We're replacing a natural gas water heater in our presentation. The steps for replacing a propane water heater are precisely the same, and those for an electric hot water heater are similar. Recurring repairs and leakages. If your water heater is over ten years old, it has likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run. As a result, we recommend changing your unit if it is over 10 years old.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have reasonably tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
