<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Gastonia NC 28054</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
