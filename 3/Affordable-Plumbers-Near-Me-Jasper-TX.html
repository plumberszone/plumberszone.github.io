The pipes themselves ought to be at least a 1/2" in diameter to supply appropriate circulation.</p>
<p>As soon as a large sufficient source of water has actually been determined and assessed, the third significant element of a water supply system enters into play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its consumers. The biggest of these primary long-distance sending pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Generally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finishing, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes developed to bring bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. Many large cities need several aqueducts supplying water from geographically separated and diverse sources.</p>
