Look out for numerous clogged drains in your house, overflowing or backed up toilets, or water spots on your walls and structure.</p>
<p>Repipers start by covering floorings and furniture to secure them from water damage and dust during the work. They then find the pipes in your walls with little cuts into the drywall of the ceilings and walls.
