Deterioration can actually eat a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it originally was or modify the tolerances causing parts to not operate in a backflow preventer.

We'll send an experienced service technician to your home when you call Pratt Plumbing. She or he will treat you with the utmost regard and courtesy.
