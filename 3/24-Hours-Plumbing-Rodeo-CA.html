<p>Physical strength. Pipefitters, plumbers, and steamfitters need to be able to lift and move heavy tools and materials. Idea: Place a heavy object such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving throughout installation.

Attempting to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are weakening gradually from the within. In many cases, repiping is your only viable option.</p>
