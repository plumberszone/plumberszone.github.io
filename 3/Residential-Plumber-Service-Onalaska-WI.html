<p>If you observe an odor or unpleasant smell coming from your system, which is not unusual, think about investing in a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where nasty smells can get away. These flanges are simple and commonly available to install, costing around $30 at home improvement or hardware stores. Shut off the supply of water to your home at the main line. To avoid leakages from springing throughout the installation process, turned off the water system to your house. Make certain your water heater's supply of water is shut off, as is the electrical power running to the unit.</p>

Most of the times, repiping is your only feasible option.</p>
