<p>No other room in a home consists of as lots of pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. When replacing an under-sink assembly, look for quality materials.

PVC assemblies are an excellent option s they can be easily connected to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and ensure it sets prior to testing the drain.</p>
