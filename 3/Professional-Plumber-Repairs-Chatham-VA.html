Plumber's putty can not be used on specific brand-new sinks, however these will be identified to that result. If you can't use plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel.
