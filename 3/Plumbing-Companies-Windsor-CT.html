After all, isn't all water soft? Fair point. However water softeners were created to fight a remarkably common problem: difficult water.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a major public health danger if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, caused the spread of illness or disease.</p>

<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt because they regrow whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, generally restore after many gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are hassle-free if you have an ever-changing water utilize schedule.</p>
