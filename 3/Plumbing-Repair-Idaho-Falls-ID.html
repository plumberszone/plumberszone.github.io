<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back since he had another appointment. A best bad plumber story.</p>

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to consider if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous years, but steel ultimately struggles with deterioration and does not have the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
