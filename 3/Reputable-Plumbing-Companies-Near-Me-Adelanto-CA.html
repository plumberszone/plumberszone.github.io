It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the salt, or salt, is saved and mixed with water. If you prepare to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not use your unit to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate intact.</p>
<p>All you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) once you have actually found the trip lever you desire remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the proper method. When you have actually protected the journey lever and are prepared to attach your flapper, make certain you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
