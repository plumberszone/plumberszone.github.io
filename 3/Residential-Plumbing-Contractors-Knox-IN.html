<p>This short article aims to address the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: an appropriately set up water softener does not make the treated water more corrosive. Here are a couple of confusing realities that typically lead people to this incorrect conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is typically destructive.

Pumps press tough water through the resin beads exchanging solidity ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
