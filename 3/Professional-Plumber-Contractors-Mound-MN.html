However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have moderately difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>

<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Mound MN 55364</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these elements are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>

Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies need to be checked with correctly adjusted gauge equipment.</p>
