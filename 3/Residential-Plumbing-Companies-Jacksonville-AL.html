The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
