<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible supply of water line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it intends directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can really cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, inspect for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>
