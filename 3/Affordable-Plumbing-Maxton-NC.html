<p>The majority of homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to corrode.

As the outer finish of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>

<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in many cases it should be much less water.</p>
