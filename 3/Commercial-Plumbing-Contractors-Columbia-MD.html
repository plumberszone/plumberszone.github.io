<p>Whenever you experience any kind of plumbing issue, the first thing you need is a right diagnosis of the issue. There can be lots of reasons someone is experiencing problems with their drains or sewer lines, and only a professional can offer an appropriate diagnosis. We ask that you do not squander at any time trying to figure out the factor behind your plumbing problems, as this can further delay looking for the professional help you need.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have moderately difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
