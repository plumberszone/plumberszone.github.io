<p>No other room in a house consists of as lots of pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. Look for quality products when changing an under-sink assembly. Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any configuration, in addition to flexible rubber traps. Debris can easily capture in this kind of piping while the piping's flexible nature does not supply required support for the drain basket. PVC assemblies are a good choice s they can be easily connected to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make certain it sets before testing the drain.</p>
