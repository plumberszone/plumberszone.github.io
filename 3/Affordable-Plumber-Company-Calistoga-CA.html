<p>No other room in a house consists of as lots of pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. Look for quality products when changing an under-sink assembly. Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any configuration, in addition to flexible rubber traps.

PVC assemblies are a good choice s they can be easily connected to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make certain it sets before testing the drain.</p>
