<p>Minerals in water are what makes sure water considered hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most typical minerals found in water. Generally, minerals arrive due to the fact that groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants take a trip with the water until it is in your house.

<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can quickly cause thousands of dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel way off schedule.

<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- destructive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is merely catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (generally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
