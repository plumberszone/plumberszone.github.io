When water service is disrupted in the street or in a structure for any factor, there is a pressure drop which can draw polluted water backwards into the water system. For example, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from cars and truck cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler may enter the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development may flow backwards into the drinkable water supply.

It is important that the repair professional is delicate to the firmness and kind of the different finishes utilized on iron body units so as not to harm the protective finish.</p>
