A house's service line (likewise called a sewer lateral) ranges from your house to the mainline sewer in the street. In many cases, the homeowner is accountable for preserving the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for maintaining the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Some states require pipefitters and steamfitters to be licensed; they might likewise need a special license to deal with gas lines. Licensing normally needs an exam or work experience or both. Contact your state's licensing board for more information.
