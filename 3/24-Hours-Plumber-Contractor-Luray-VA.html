<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler typically are set up in areas where water might cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>This article intends to resolve the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: a properly set up water softener does not make the cured water more destructive. Here are a few confusing facts that frequently lead people to this incorrect conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is normally destructive. Therefore, softened water must also be corrosive, right? This is a fallacy due to the fact that naturally soft water tends to be corrosive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>
