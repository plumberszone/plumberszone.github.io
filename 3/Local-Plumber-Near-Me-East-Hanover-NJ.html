<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and get rid of water molecules from the solution with solidity ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water particles for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is without hardness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter needing regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
