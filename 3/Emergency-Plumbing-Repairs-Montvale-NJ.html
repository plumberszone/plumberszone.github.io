<p>Dry pipe systems typically are installed in large, unheated locations, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, permitting the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
<p>Physical strength. Pipefitters, plumbers, and steamfitters must be able to lift and move heavy tools and products. Suggestion: Place a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving throughout installation.
