<p>Hard water use may affect the performance of household appliances. When warmed, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the warm water heater. A big scale buildup slows the heating process and requires more energy to heat water. Water heaters with large build-ups of mineral accumulation will have a shorter life span. Scale deposits also accumulate to plug plumbing fixtures and build up in other devices such as coffee pots and dishwashing machines, hence impacting their performance.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have moderately hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
