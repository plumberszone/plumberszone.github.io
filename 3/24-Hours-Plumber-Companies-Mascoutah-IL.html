<p>Sewer lines have one important function: carry wastewater out of a home or building. Although these house owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline prior to the issue worsened. Waiting simply wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely expensive choice.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing professionals can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by linking a hose to drain the tank to an ideal drain. Flushing the water heating tank need to be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner might provide a fast fix in the short-term, it can cause much more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run.

This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
