<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Bonner Springs KS</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another typical leak-prone area. These can likewise be difficult to repair as they are normally situated behind the sink, in cramped spaces. The best way to tighten them is with a pair of locking pliers. Wrenches use up excessive space and need a broad swing angle, which may be hard to obtain in small spaces.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits collect, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
