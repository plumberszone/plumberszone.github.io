<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Benton AR</h3>
<p>We're changing a natural gas hot water heater in our presentation. The steps for changing a gas water heater are exactly the same, and those for an electrical water heater are comparable. Repeating leaks and repairs. If your hot water heater is over ten years old, it has likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not economical in the long run. As a result, we advise changing your system if it is over 10 years old.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have moderately tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
