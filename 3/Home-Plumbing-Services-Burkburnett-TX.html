<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
