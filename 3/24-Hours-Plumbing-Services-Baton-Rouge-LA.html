If you have an unusual flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task. To discover a suitable replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Switch off the water before getting rid of the flapper.)

If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
