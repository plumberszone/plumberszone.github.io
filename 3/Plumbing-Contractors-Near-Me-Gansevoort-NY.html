<p>Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on really gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to ensure no valves were unintentionally exposed or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized.
