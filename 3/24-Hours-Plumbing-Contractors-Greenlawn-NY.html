<p>The Required Inspections Table revealed listed below lists those inspections that need to be performed to confirm that your work adheres to the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code. Please note that Virginia's Building regulations forbids using any plumbing components or devices prior to approval of all needed inspections. We hope this list is helpful to you throughout the course of your project. Please call our Building Inspections Department, at 804-501-4360, if you have any concerns about what is required for each inspection or if you need help scheduling an inspection. Building, Electrical, Mechanical or Fire Defense work require additional authorizations and inspections. Different notices are offered to explain the inspections needed for each kind of permit.</p>
<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in most cases it need to be much less water.</p>
