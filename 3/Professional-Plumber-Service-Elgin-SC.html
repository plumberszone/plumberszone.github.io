<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that permits water to go through it in one direction, however prevents it from reversing in the opposite instructions. You might be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, simply put, the same thing, but without the zinc coating. The zinc finish on galvanized pipe for gas is indicated to keep the pipe from wearing away from contact with wetness. While it does its job pretty well, over time, it still does corrode. This allows the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
<p>This, again, is due to the minerals present in the water you are using to clean them with. With soft water, you don't have that problem due to the fact that it lacks the minerals that are in tough water. Whether you're trying to find a standard toilet from a trustworthy brand or a newer style with modern-day functions, Master Plumbing & Mechanical can help you select the best toilet for your needs and carry out a professional installation.</p>
