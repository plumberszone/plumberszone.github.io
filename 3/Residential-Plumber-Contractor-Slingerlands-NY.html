<p>Your house's drains and pipes silently remove thousands of gallons of wastewater from your house every year without you even providing a reservation. However, when hair, food scraps, feminine hygiene products, toys, and other foreign objects make their way into your drains, they can result in severe problems. While sometimes it's obvious you need drain cleaning (when your bathroom sink is completely stopped-up, or there's gurgling in your kitchen drains, for example), it can in some cases be harder to tell if you have a problem on your hands.</p>
<p>If the sink is no longer draining as rapidly as it as soon as did, there's a likelihood it's since the garbage disposal is clogged. Not only can a clogged disposal cause the sink to drain slowly, it can also cause filthy water to flow back into the sink. A waste disposal unit repair service can help identify and fix a clogged waste disposal unit.</p>
