<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a practical option, particularly when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are lots of disadvantages to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they typically include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your home and family.</p>
