<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
