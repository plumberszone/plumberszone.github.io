<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Get rid of all parts of the disposer package from the box, and organize the contents. Eliminate the P-trap and existing drain basket assembly thoroughly from the sink (Images 1 and 2).
