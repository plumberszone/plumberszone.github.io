<p>When a big enough source of water has actually been determined and examined, the third significant component of a water system system comes into play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its customers. The biggest of these primary long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Normally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finishing, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes developed to bring bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the flows are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Most large cities need a number of aqueducts supplying water from geographically separated and diverse sources.</p>
