<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- destructive. For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of rust A softener is merely catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (normally salt or often potassium).</p>
