<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Reading PA</h3>
<p>In the 1990 ′ s, drought conditions motivated water companies to carry out water preservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in residences were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush models. Continuous blockages: If the plunger has become a regular component in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Constant clogs indicate your toilet no longer has the power needed to efficiently get rid of waste with each flush.</p>
<p>To make placing a toilet easier, new toilet bolts are extra long. That indicates you have to cut off the protruding ends later on with a hacksaw. But very first connect the water line, flush the toilet a couple of times and check for leaks. Leaving the bolts uncut up until you have actually done these final checks lets you easily get rid of and reset the toilet if you discover any problems.</p>
