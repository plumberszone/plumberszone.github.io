<p>Rust: The most typical issue is rust in the tank and pipes that connect to your water heater.

Whether it's calcium, iron, or another element that is causing the rust, you will ultimately experience a leak in your hot water heater that is challenging to repair. Leaks typically indicate a new unit replacement remains in order.</p>
<p>If there is a leak, we will locate the leak and shut the gas line down at the main line if it has not currently been finished. Then, our technician will dig to discover the gas line and leak. The gas line will be replaced and pressure checked to ensure there are no leaks. If the leak is adequately repaired, the site will be cleaned up and brought back to its previous splendor.</p>

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and local water suppliers manage these state requirements.

For that reason, all backflow prevention assemblies need to be evaluated regularly to ensure that they are functioning correctly. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies need to be tested with correctly adjusted gauge equipment.</p>
