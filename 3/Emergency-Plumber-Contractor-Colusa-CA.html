<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
