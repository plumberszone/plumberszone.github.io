<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in Hallandale FL 33009</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
