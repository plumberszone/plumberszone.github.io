When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. If allowed to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the infected water to become a health threat. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for efficiency, in addition to checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
