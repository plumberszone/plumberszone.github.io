<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Why is it exceptionally important to keep your bathroom and kitchen sinks in an excellent working condition? Lots of homeowners do not even ask such a concern, they believe that a leaky bathroom or split sink is not a huge deal. and neglect these unpleasant problems.
