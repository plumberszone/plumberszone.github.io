<p>Leakages are sneaky. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, providing the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
