<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a practical option, particularly when basic plunging doesn't appear to work.

These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.
