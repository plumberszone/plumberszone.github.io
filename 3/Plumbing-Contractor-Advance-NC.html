<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Advance NC</h3>
<p>The City of Bellingham needs a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the structure, or in both places. The backflow preventer you choose must be noted on the Washington State Department of Health's Authorized Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently listed should have been listed at the time of the original installation.</p>
<p>We need to clarify a little terms before we continue with a backflow prevention assembly repair. A backflow prevention assembly includes an inlet and outlet shut off, appropriately located test cocks, and the essential components of the assembly (check valves, relief valve or air inlet).

Backflow parts are put together to make parts, and elements are assembled to make a backflow prevention assembly.</p>
