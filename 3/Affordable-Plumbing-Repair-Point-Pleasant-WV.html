<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To eliminate the disposer, support it from below and turn the big, 3-tab mounting ring on top counterclockwise up until the unit falls away. Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and prying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
