<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal service is to have the defective pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in.

Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous years, but steel eventually suffers from deterioration and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
