<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Installing the new drain is a basic matter: First, develop a snake out of plumber's putty and circle the drain from the top. Then install the leading half of the drain from the top, and screw the nut and mounting bracket on from below. Make certain to remove any excess plumber's putty utilizing a putty knife. I recently needed to replace the water heater in my house and it was just 6 years of ages. Traditional hot water heater with a tank must generally last 10 to 15 years. I likewise have a dishwasher in my kitchen that has not been used in more than two years. Washing dishes is my least favorite task, especially without the help of a dishwasher.</p>
