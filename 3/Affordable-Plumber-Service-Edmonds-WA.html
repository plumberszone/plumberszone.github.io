<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
