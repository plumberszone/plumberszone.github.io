<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Bala Cynwyd PA</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Examine the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and switch on the disposal to ensure it works. Examine below to be sure there aren't any leaks. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of appropriately. Pipes made from galvanized steel are no longer used in brand-new homes, however many houses constructed between the 1930s - 1980s still have them. Galvanized steel pipes need to be eliminated by a professional plumber when found and changed with another pipe material.</p>
