<p>Once a big sufficient source of water has been determined and evaluated, the third significant element of a water system system enters into play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its consumers. The biggest of these main long-distance transmitting pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Typically built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finishing, these are big underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Most big cities need a number of aqueducts providing water from geographically apart and diverse sources.</p>
