<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a variety of materials were utilized for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these products are long lasting in the short-term, they deteriorate over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to several kinds of deterioration.
