<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. Some softeners deal with electrical power, but some more recent water softeners utilize waterpower.

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems usually are installed in locations where water could trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>Sadly, when water is totally stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it frequently becomes destructive.
