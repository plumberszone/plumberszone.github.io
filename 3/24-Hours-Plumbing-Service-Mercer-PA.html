<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Mercer PA</h3>
<p>A newly set up water heater should not produce unusual noises, but it will begin to generate rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder with time as the heater runs to heat the water. Things intensify significantly for homes with a high need for warm water. The reasons for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to bring back normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement might be necessary.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
