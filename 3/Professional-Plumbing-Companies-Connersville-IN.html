<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic.

I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most common.

Eliminate the rest of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and spying off the retaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
