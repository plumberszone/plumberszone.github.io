Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a correctly working RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in areas based on water damage. Adequate drainage should likewise be supplied.</p>
