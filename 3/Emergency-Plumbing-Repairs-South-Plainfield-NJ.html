We discover that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older house and are experiencing frequent and major leakages. If you do have regular leaks, we discover that repiping can really be the less expensive and better long-term option.</p>
