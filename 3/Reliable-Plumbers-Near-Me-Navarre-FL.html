Due to the fact that the plumber has to replace the secondary drain and incoming lines (see image below) for each plumbing component, that's. Replacing the pipes for numerous plumbing fixtures requires more labor and pipe, which increases cost.</p>
<p>Most plumbers will remove the old unit to install the new one at the exact same hourly rate. This can increase the quantity of time required to install the new unit, therefore increasing costs. This really depends on what condition the remainder of the pipes remain in, and how hard the old unit is to get rid of. In many cases, removal will only include an additional $25 to $50 to the total expenses, but in many cases the expenses might be higher if additional pipes need to also be changed.</p>
