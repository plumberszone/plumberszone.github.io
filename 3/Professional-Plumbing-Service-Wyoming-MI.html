<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts might have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each element. If the element is not repaired correctly, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or consistent) of the component, which might trigger the element to not work to its abilities.

In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
