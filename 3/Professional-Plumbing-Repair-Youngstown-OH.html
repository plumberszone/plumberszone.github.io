These flanges are simple and commonly readily available to install, costing around $30 in your home improvement or hardware stores. Shut off the water supply to your home at the main line. To prevent leaks from springing during the installation process, shut down the supply of water to your house. Ensure your hot water heater's supply of water is shut off, as is the electrical energy running to the system.</p>
