<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>

<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals state, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a frequent occurrence, but it does take place regularly than you believe! When you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes, often it occurs at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction projects quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another common cause of backflow. Fire engine utilize big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>
