Paper towels can rapidly block the toilet drain line or cause a clog further down the drainpipe. Feminine health items must be disposed of in the garbage and never ever in the toilet.</p>
<p>Building codes can differ from city to city, however all serve the same function. The comprehensive list of provisions and rules list the minimum requirements for the style and construction of a commercial or residential structure.

<p>Some pipe products are cheaper than others; some are more vulnerable and fragile to breaking, displacement or other kinds of structural failure.

And these differences dictate the potential need for backflow preventers.</p>
<p>Discharge piping connected to a storm sewer will be equipped with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for instance, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices suggests a DCV assembly on wet or dry sprinkler systems unless there is a threat of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is suggested.</p>
