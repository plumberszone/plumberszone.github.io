<p>Leakages are sly. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a process called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
