<p>If you have a dishwasher, or want to get one down the line, then make sure the waste disposal unit you put in has an attachment for this. This is a perfect version as waste from the dishwasher can clean directly into the disposal system. Even if you do not have need for a dishwasher, if your house ever changes hands, new owners may appreciate the choice.</p>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is since the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however most of the times it must be much less water.</p>
