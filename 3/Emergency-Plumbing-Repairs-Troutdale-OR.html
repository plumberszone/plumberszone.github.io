<p>Many homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather condition defense. As the outer finishing of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
