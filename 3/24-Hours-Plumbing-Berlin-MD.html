For instance, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from vehicle cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler may get in the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development might stream backwards into the potable water system.
