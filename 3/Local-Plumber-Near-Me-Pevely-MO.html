It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
