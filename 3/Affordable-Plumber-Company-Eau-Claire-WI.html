<p>While garbage disposals work fantastic for breaking down light food residue, they are not created to manage large amounts of waste. In some cases, a metal item, such as a staple, coin, or utensil, can jam a disposal. If a waste disposal unit is overwhelmed, property owners can may be able to correct the issue by striking the reset button on the disposal or removing the foreign things with a set of pliers after turning off the power at the circuit breaker.
