<h3>Easy Basic Kitchen Faucet Repair at Palatka FL 32177</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
