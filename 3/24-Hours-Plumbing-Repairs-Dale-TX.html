If your energy expenses are rising, a new, higher effectiveness hot water heater can bring them back down. All that needs to be done is shutting off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, permitting difficult water to flow to the tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, transferred to its new place and placed there.</p>

There are whole-house heaters that are big and effective enough to provide hot water to all restrooms, kitchens, and appliances in a house.

Both whole-house and point-of-use heaters work the exact same method. The only difference is the amount of water they can warm up at any given time. Also, whole-house units are substantially more costly than the point of use systems.</p>
