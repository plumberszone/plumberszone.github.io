<p>All you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) as soon as you've discovered the journey lever you desire remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Remember that since of the method a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the right method. When you have actually secured the trip lever and are prepared to attach your flapper, make certain you've got simply enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
