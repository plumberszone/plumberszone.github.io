This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is merely capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (usually salt or often potassium).</p>
