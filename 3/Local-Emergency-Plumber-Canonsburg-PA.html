<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits accumulate, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits take place more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you wish to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
