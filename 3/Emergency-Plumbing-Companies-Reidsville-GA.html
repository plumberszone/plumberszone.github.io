<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
