The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
