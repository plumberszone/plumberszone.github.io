<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
<p>The area under your kitchen sink has actually gotten more crowded for many years. Initially, there would have been a cold and hot water line increasing to the faucet (normally with shut-off valves for each) and a single drain pipe with a curved trap.
