<p>Have utilized Plumb Crazy on 3 different occasions, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our specialists and they were wonderful. They quickly discovered the leak and fixed it without making a big mess.

<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are mainly time related. If everything is prepared, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or more of time. If things need to be customized, replaced, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours required and for that reason the total expenses. The majority of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with many disposal installations running $50 per hour for three hours total, making the labor expenses approximately $150.</p>
