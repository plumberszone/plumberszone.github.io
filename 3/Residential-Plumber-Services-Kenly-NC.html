<p>As soon as the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to guarantee no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close correctly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or system to avoid backflow. The fundamental means of preventing backflow is an air space, which either removes a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow.

The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
