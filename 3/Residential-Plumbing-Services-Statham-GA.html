<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
