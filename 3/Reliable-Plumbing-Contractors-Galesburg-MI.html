<p>When compared to gas designs, electrical designs are easier and less costly to install as electricity is already offered through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a specific gas line needs to be set up and a feasible source of gas established. Another function of an electric hot water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas models need to be ventilated properly utilizing vents and ducts in order to operate properly. With electric designs, you will not have to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your house.</p>

At Premier Plumbing we help you make the best decision based your requirements so you understand that the water heater you buy is the best one for your house or service at the lowest cost possible. Clogged Toilet: For toilets that are severely clogged, we will snake the drain to remove it once and for all.</p>

The hot water heater tank need to have some room to account for the expansion that occurs when heating the water. The thermal expansion requires to leave, thus the need for an expansion tank to help control the pressure. If the tank is old and broken, the force applied by the growth occurring when boiling the water causes the reservoir to break and start leaking.
