<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have moderately hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
