<p>Any appliance that utilizes water, from little coffee pots to large refrigerators, operates more efficiently in a house with softened water. This is because there's no limescale accumulation to hinder moving heat or obstructing pipes. Improved performance also suggests that you'll take pleasure in a decline in your energy expenses, as your appliances will not need to work more difficult or utilize more water in order to work at their best.</p>
<p>Difficult water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>A well-designed watering system is important for the health of plants in a landscape but it's also crucial for human health. A successful irrigation system keeps the water for landscapes different from potable drinking water, avoiding contamination that can cause illnesses. That's why a backflow preventer is a necessity on any watering project.</p>
