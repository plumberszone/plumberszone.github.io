<p>If you have a garbage disposal, you can attempt discarding a tray of ice down the drain, and then turn on the garbage disposal while running water.

No problem is too great for our highly trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our skilled plumbing team gets the job done quickly and economically.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
<p>We are always ready to go the extra mile to supply the most truthful, efficient, professional, trustworthy and friendly heating contractor services offered throughout Seattle. Disconnect the disposal from the flange assembly and eliminate it from the drain. Bought the Insinkerator from Lowes for $199 + $15 tax. Installation by a plumber cost $275, but he also needed to replace corroded inlet pipes. About 1.5 hours total.</p>
