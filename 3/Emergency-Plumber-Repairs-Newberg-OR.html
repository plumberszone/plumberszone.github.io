Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak.

He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load.
