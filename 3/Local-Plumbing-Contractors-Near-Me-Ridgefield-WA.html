<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure.

To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
