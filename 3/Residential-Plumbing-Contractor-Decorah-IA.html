<p>In some neighborhoods, house water softeners drain to municipal wastewater treatment plants, which are not created to eliminate chloride.

In houses with private wells and house softeners, chloride drains to the home's septic system and after that ends up in lakes and streams.</p>

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

If you observe a leak, get it repaired as soon as you can. Linking irrigation to water fountains, swimming pools and garden ponds forbade: State law and City regulation hold that no watering system may be connected to a fountain, swimming pool, or garden pond.
