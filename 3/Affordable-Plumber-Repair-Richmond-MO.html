<h3>Shower Faucet Repair in Richmond Missouri</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water innovation start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, announced today they have attained a development in water softening treatment using an exclusive Surface area Accelerated Condensation (SACr) innovation. SACr physically eliminates temporary solidity without using chemicals or high pressure, which are major constraints of existing softening technologies.</p>

This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
