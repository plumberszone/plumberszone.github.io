<p>Pipeline leak detection is used to identify if and in some cases where a leak has actually occurred in systems which contain liquids and gases. Remove itchy rashes and experience smoother, softer skin and hair with a point-of-use shower head water softener.

<p>Finally, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 separately operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. Throughout basic water streams at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if costly) device is best utilized in critical locations where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
