<h3>Safe Alternatives In Fixing A Blocked Drain in Stephenville TX 76401</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>Stegle states that when they are dealing with a customer on a custom house, they will work directly with the property owner when it comes to picking faucets and other components. As a subcontractor, those decisions might have currently been made. We have developed a group of contractors we've worked for in the past, and this has actually resulted in some service that has not involved competitive bidding," Stegle says.</p>
<p>Have actually utilized Plumb Crazy on three various occasions, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our specialists and they were wonderful. They rapidly found the leak and fixed it without making a big mess. They, just like everyone we've experienced with Plumb Crazy, were considerate, timely, and extremely experienced. I would recommend Plumb Crazy to anyone needing either small or large task plumbing work.</p>
