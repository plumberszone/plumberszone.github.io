<p>Leaks are tricky. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>

If the component is not repaired correctly, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than constant or direct) of the part, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities.
