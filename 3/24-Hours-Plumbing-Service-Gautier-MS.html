<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back since he had another visit. A best bad plumber story.</p>
<p>The area under your kitchen sink has gotten more crowded for many years. Originally, there would have been a hot and cold  water line increasing to the faucet (typically with shut-off valves for each) and a single drain pipe with a curved trap.
