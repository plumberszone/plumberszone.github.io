Typically built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finishing, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes designed to bring bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the flows are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. Most big cities need numerous aqueducts providing water from varied and geographically apart sources.</p>
