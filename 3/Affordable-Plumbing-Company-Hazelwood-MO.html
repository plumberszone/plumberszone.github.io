<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one ought to first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
