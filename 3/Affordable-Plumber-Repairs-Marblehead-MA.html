<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by straightening it. Obviously, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it might be long enough to reach some obstructions. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or take out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
