<p>Difficult water usage may affect the efficiency of household appliances. When heated, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the warm water heater. A large scale accumulation slows the heating process and needs more energy to heat water. Water heaters with large accumulations of mineral accumulation will have a much shorter life span. Scale deposits also accumulate to plug plumbing fixtures and build up in other appliances such as coffee pots and dishwashers, hence affecting their performance.</p>

Setups must only be carried out by plumbers as the installation requires both plumbing and electrical connections.</p>
