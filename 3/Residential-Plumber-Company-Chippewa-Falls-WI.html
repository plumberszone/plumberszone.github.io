<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Chippewa Falls WI 54729</h3>
<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is just recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (usually salt or often potassium).</p>
