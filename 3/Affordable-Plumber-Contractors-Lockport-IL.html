Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
