<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Prestonsburg KY 41653</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months back. I feel that costs were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending upon the market and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>From below the sink, place a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Protect the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make sure the drain compression seal is seated effectively in the drain locknut, then reinstall and tighten up the drain locknut. Lastly, turn on the water and test for leaks.</p>
<p>Our skilled professionals have lots of systems and techniques of the trade that can actually reduce the impact on the house and avoid much of the wall and tile repair. From threading pipes through existing holes to specifically created cover plates for shower valves, it may not be as invasive as you might believe. That being stated, there are, of course, sometimes when we will be opening a wall to gain access to piping. The bright side is that we can include wall repair in our scope so that you are not left searching for multiple contractors to get the task finished.</p>

With over twenty years of experience in the field, our group is educated, professional, and sincere. Our company believe in treating you like family, not a one-time client.
