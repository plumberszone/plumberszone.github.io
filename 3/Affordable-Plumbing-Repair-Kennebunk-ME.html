<p>A continuous-feed garbage disposal is the most typical type which continues to run as long as the power switch is on. A continuous-feed disposal is best for combating large amounts of food waste. The majority of garbage disposals are plug-in, as it is much safer to have a vibrating unit come unplugged then disconnected from fixed circuitry.

<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
