<p>Water softeners add worth to your operation by securing your water-using devices from poor performance and early failure. Some difficult water problems are very visible, like dispensers and sprayers ending up being clogged. Other problems can go undiscovered, like scale on water heater elements and buildup in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Visible or undetectable, these problems have actually real expenses related to them. Clogged components trigger replacement or reconditioning costs and can annoy your clients. Scale buildup in your water heater will inflate your energy costs, and too soon damaged RO membranes will leave you with unneeded replacement expenses.
