<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning group is proud to use Bio-Clean products for each drain-cleaning task. Bio-Clean is a natural service that's both safe to your plumbing and extremely reliable at removing gunk, waste, and natural material that so often congests your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, wearing away the sidewalls and only partially repairing the problem. Bio-Clean is a solution of live germs that actively look for natural material and eat away at it, developing harmless by-products of carbon mineral, water, and dioxide ash, all of which are easily treated at local sewage plants.</p>
<p>If you want it to work well for years to come, your garbage disposal installation requires to be carried out by a professional plumber.
