Identify the size of the water pipes in the home and around the house - they will help to identify the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be adequate, the lines should be 3/4" to one inch straight from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves ought to be at least a 1/2" in size to provide adequate circulation.</p>

<h3>Water Heater Repair & Replacement in Fraser Michigan</h2>
<p>Yes, we've all been there, when the toilet obstructions and we're left sensation helpless without the power to flush! A clog typically involves rising water, followed by panic and plunging. There's most likely a bigger issue of obstruction in the drainpipe or sewer-line if this is a common incident. Our plumbers can assist you to eliminate the issue and identify-- fast.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return since he had another visit. A best bad plumber story.</p>
