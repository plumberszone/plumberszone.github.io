<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Altoona WI</h3>
<p>Though water line replacement seems like your house's equivalent of major surgery, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it just means old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We discover that homes 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing frequent and major leakages, you might be in need of water line repiping. We find that repiping can actually be the more affordable and much better long-lasting service if you do have frequent leaks.</p>
