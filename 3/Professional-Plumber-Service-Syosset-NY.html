But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have moderately hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
