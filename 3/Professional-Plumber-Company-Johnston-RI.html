<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Johnston RI</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>From the above description of the working of a toilet, you can see that it is comprised of numerous mechanical parts which, with time, go through wear and tear and may need to be changed. Some property owners have actually taken it upon themselves to determine how to replace these parts but numerous do not understand how to do it or can refrain from doing it well. This is where Matt's Plumbing would come into play. When in doubt, always provide us a call and we will fix any of your plumbing problems with the correct tools and years of knowledge.
