<p>The City of Bellingham needs a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or potential cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be needed on the water service line, within the building, or in both areas. The backflow preventer you select need to be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Authorized Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently listed need to have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile water system line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can actually cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leaks and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
