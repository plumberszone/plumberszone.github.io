<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
<p>The specialist, Kenny, was polite, informative and professional! He asked me to look at the camera with him then described my alternatives without attempting to oversell me! I would extremely advise the Clog Dawg for an once or annual inspection if you presume that roots may be triggering havoc in your drainage pipes.
