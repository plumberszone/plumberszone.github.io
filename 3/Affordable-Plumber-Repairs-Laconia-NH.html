<p>Lastly, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 individually running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water flows at style pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if expensive) device is best used in critical locations where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
<p>No house owner wants to handle inefficient plumbing, especially when it can cost thousands in repairs.

Harmed sewer lines can lead to bathrooms flooded with sewage, damaged pipes, and expensive repairs.</p>
