<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Sussex NJ</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Check the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and switch on the disposal to make certain it works. Check beneath to be sure there aren't any leaks. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of properly. Pipes made of galvanized steel are no longer used in brand-new homes, however numerous homes built between the 1930s - 1980s still have them. When discovered and replaced with another pipe material, galvanized steel pipes need to be removed by a professional plumber.</p>
