Tankless water heaters cost more to buy and install than storage systems but save money on both energy and water by removing standby heat loss and heating water quicker so less cold water is squandered while you wait.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that it is more affordable to power them with gas than with electricity, these types of hot water heaters are generally powered by natural gas. Gas hot water heater cost more than electric hot water heater to install initially, but wind up costing about half as much to run - saving you substantial quantities of money on your energy costs in the long run.</p>
