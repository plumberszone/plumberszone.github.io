<p>If your old disposal is broken beyond repair, you'll have to replace it. Although any broken appliance is frustrating to handle, fortunately is that setting up a replacement disposal will be less expensive than setting up a brand-new waste disposal unit in a sink that has never ever had one before. Depending on the pro you deal with, it can be as much as half the rate.</p>
<p>In fact, reverse flow testing designed to ensure that backflow preventers avoid backflow was eliminated from NFPA 25 in 2011.
