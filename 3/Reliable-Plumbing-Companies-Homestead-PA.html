<p>Leakages - If your water heater is leaking, you might need to replace the system. In time leakages can cause other problems and even cause mold to grow around the system. If you see a leak, get it fixed as soon as you can. Connecting irrigation to water fountains, swimming pools and garden ponds prohibited: State law and City regulation hold that no irrigation system may be connected to a water fountain, swimming pool, or garden pond. These water features might just be filled with drinkable water. Water which has gone into an irrigation system is not safe and clean.</p>
