<p>Water softeners add worth to your operation by securing your water-using equipment from bad performance and premature failure. Some difficult water problems are really visible, like sprayers and dispensers ending up being clogged. Other problems can go undetected, like scale on water heater elements and accumulation in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Invisible or noticeable, these problems have real expenses connected with them. Clogged components cause replacement or refurbishing expenses and can irritate your customers. Scale accumulation in your hot water heater will inflate your energy costs, and too soon damaged RO membranes will leave you with unnecessary replacement costs. Soon, these little expenses can add up to make a genuine effect on your bottom line.</p>
