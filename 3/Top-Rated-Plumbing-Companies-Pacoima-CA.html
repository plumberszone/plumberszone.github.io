If your showers become frustrating, or it appears little to no water is draining of your faucets, it could be time for a sewer repair. The cost is dependent on the size of the home and the number of bathrooms and plumbing components-- laundry room, wet bar, mud room, etc. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to access to the plumbing will add $500 or more to your last expenses.</p>
