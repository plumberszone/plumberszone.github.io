<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular event, but it does occur more frequently than you believe! When you do not notice the water was off for a few minutes, typically it occurs at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs easily the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Similar to kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your sink, shower, or bathtub) can be treated quickly if the clog is simple and shallow. For many clogs you'll just need a plunger, and in some cases some chemicals, however if this doesn't solve the problem then you might also have to call in a drain specialist like Reckon & Reckon to assist. As a bathroom drain is also more difficult to replace and repair than a kitchen sink drain, it's most likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
