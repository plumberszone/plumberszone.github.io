<p>Minerals in water are what ensures water thought about hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most common minerals discovered in water. Normally, minerals get there due to the fact that groundwater will dissolve rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the residues take a trip with the water up until it remains in your house. Water softening utilizes an ion exchange process to remove liquified minerals that aren't as efficiently eliminated by mechanical filtration. These materials are what causes difficult water.</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
