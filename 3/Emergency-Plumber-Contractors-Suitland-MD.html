<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
