<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load.
