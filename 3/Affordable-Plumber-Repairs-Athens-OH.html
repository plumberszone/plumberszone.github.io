<p>City of Bellingham examines backflow assemblies upon installation and performs regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies need to be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report should be supplied to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste much better. The minerals in difficult water can trigger a bad odor and taste. When you add a water softener, it removes the mineral material to produce odorless drinking water that tastes great.</p>

<p>A review of the hydraulic conditions present at the assembly need to then be assessed. There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure variations and disc compression that could cause false data on the functions of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can cause severe pressure spikes that could harm components. The results of raised temperature can likewise cause excessive pressure conditions which might damage the parts in the parts. These and other unfavorable results from the hydraulic conditions should be recognized and their cause corrected. If parts are replaced and the hydraulic conditions are not corrected, the brand-new parts can soon be made inoperative.</p>
<p>Within commercial facilities, DCV and RPZ backflow prevention systems must be inspected, preserved, and tested with regularity. Without consistent testing and servicing, these systems can permit contaminated water to stream easily within your supply pipes, developing a major health risk to constructing occupants. Each backflow prevention system requires different testing procedures and intervals, and demands considerable experience and understanding.</p>
