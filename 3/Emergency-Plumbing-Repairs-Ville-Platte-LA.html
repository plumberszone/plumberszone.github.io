Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
