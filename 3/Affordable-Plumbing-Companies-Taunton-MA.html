To keep your sink smelling fresh and running clear, pour in equivalent parts of vinegar and baking soda regularly. For regular cleaning, you'll simply need about one-half cup of each.

<p>Debris such as foreign objects - Objects such as soap, hair, food and even small toys can become trapped between your drain and your pipes. These will eventually obstruct the circulation of your water before causing a clog. Also, if too much toilet paper is flushed down your toilet, or sanitary items are flushed, a clog can occur. Thermostat problems: The thermostat controls the temperature level of the water heater. If this component malfunctions, you might be entrusted water that is scalding hot or freezing cold.</p>

<p>A typical gas line can cost as much as $1,000. The labor expenses increase if the gas line is under a walkway, sprinkler system or trees.
