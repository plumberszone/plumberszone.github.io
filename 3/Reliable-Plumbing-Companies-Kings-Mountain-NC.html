<p>Once the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on extremely slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to make sure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close appropriately. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
