Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can become infected. If allowed to re-enter the supply of water, there is capacity for the infected water to end up being a health hazard. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for efficiency, along with inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
