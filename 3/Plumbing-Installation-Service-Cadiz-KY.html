<h3>You Can Save Money With Water Leak Detection in Cadiz KY 42211</h3>
<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is one of the least expensive backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage only for non-health threat or health hazard conditions. They should be installed downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local officials, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can just protect against back siphonage.</p>
