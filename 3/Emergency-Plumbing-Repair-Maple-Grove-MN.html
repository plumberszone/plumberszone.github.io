<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have moderately difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
