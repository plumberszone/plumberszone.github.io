<p>For instance, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Because pressure is lost throughout these events, water is no longer being pushed forward into your house and will flow backwards into the city water lines.

You can buy, with complimentary shipping, a leading name-brand filtration or softener system by shopping at Any installation services below can then assist with installation, or you can just install the system yourself.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have reasonably tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
