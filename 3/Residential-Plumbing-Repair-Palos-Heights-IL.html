<p>Leakages are tricky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
