<p>Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the drinkable water supply within a structure these devices are called isolation" BFP. Once again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no way to provide one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is installed.

<p>A newly installed water heater must not produce strange noises, but it will start to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder gradually as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things aggravate considerably for households with a high demand for hot water. The reasons for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to restore normalcy. A hot water heater replacement might be required if the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed.</p>
