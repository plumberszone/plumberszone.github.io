<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as difficult water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
