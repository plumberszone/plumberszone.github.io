<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent event, but it does occur regularly than you believe! When you do not observe the water was off for a couple of minutes, often it happens at night. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or connect a new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs easily the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another common reason for backflow. Fire engine use huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>The typical service is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for numerous years, but steel ultimately experiences rust and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
