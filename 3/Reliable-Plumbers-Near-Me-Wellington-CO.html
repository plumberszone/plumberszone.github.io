<p>In order to repipe your house, Cabrillo will need to remove little areas of your drywall so we can access and replace your pipes. Depending upon the size of your home, this procedure will likely take a few days to a week to finish. Do not stress, while we're working on your home we'll cover all of your furnishings, floors and other personal belongings so that our work does not make a mess. After the entire process is finished and your home is cleaned up, we'll test to ensure that water is streaming effectively through all of your new pipes.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no close-by utilities or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining could conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and detach the drainpipes. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
