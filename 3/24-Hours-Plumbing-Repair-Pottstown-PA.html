<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners remove calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Simply put, soft water saves you money. Reduced Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of two individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and below the very first check valve.</p>
<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows take place from them, these water functions are considered a health threat. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and place need to be shown on building and construction strategies. Any backflow preventer set up on a water fountain or garden pond need to be checked upon installation and then each year.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
