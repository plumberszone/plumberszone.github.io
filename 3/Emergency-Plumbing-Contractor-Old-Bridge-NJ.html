<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that enables water to go through it in one instructions, but avoids it from reversing in the opposite direction. You might be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, put simply, the exact same thing, however without the zinc finishing. The zinc finish on galvanized pipe for gas is meant to keep the pipe from wearing away from contact with wetness. While it does its job pretty well, gradually, it still does wear away. This enables the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
