<p>Changing your flapper might require a little different steps than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To find a suitable replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You might not discover an identical match, however possibilities are you'll find among the very same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
