<p>All you really need to do is (CAREFULLY!) as soon as you've discovered the journey lever you want remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Keep in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the correct method. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are prepared to link your flapper, make sure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on three different occasions, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home.

I would suggest Plumb Crazy to anyone needing either little or big task plumbing work.</p>
