<p>Deterioration: The most typical issue is rust in the tank and pipes that link to your water heater. This is particularly real if you have unattended tough water, which consists of severe minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the material in time.

Leakages frequently mean a new unit replacement is in order.</p>
