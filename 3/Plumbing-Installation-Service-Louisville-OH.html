Through a process called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, heater, and boiler, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits.

In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can dramatically limit the water flow, which puts excessive pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
