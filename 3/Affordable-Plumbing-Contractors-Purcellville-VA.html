Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
