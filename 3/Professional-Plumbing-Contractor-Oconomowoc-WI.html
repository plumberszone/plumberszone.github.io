<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a really vital part of the design of each part. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than direct or stable) of the element, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
