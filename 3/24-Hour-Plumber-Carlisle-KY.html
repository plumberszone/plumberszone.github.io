Work of sprinklerfitters is anticipated to increase as states continue to embrace modifications to developing codes that require using fire suppression systems. If there was an existing disposal connected to the sink already, it's likely that the brand-new unit will fit the existing bracket. If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in location-- start by eliminating the old drain. Most drains are attached to the sink by a big nut below the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen up.</p>
