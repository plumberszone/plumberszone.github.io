<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in Milan TN 38358</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the market and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
