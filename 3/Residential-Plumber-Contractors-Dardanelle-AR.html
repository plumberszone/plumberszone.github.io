<p>As soon as you've found the trip lever you want, all you really need to do is (CAREFULLY!) eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the appropriate way. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are all set to hook up your flapper, ensure you've got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the trip lever.</p>

The ideal hot water heater can keep your baths and showers comfortable, your dishes clean, and your clothes cleaned-- all at a temperature level that works best for the soaps you're using. Shut off the water at the valves under the sink, and turn on the faucet to permit the water to drain. Make sure the drains are plugged to prevent little parts from falling in.</p>
