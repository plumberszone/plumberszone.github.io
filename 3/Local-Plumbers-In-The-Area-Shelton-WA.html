<p>Reminder: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not prevent back-pressure.

<p>Lots of bad things are being stated on this article about liners. I find that many old time plumbers are not informed on liners and have no idea on what they are saying. Will likewise say something does not work well simply because they do not like the innovation and not because it doesn't work. The piping process includes to the installation costs if this heater is set up in a house with numerous restrooms.</p>
