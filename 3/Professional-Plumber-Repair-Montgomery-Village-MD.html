A traditional tank water heater typically lasts anywhere from 8-12 years before requiring a replacement, while a tankless water heater can last up to 20 with correct maintenance and care.

The thermal growth requires to escape, thus the need for a growth tank to assist control the pressure. If the tank is old and broken, the force applied by the expansion taking place when boiling the water causes the reservoir to break and begin leaking.
