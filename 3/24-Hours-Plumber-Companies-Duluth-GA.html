<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Duluth GA</h3>
<p>The majority of homes or structures that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the outer finish of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>A plumbing inspection is a methodical process of evaluating the critical areas of the plumbing system of a residential or commercial property.
