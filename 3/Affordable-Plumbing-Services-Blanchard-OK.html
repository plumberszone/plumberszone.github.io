<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to identify.</p>
