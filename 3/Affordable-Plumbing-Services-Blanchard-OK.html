<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the basic structural integrity of the system.

Inappropriate installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to identify.</p>
