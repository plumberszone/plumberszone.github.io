Fill the sink with water and touch a facial tissue between the bottom of the kitchen sink drain and the sink. If the tissue picks up any water, you've got a leaky basket strainer and it's time to learn how to remove a sink drain. It's time to replace the lines if your gas line has passed its useful age. And when you need new gas lines set up, there is just one company to contact Western Michigan - Service Teacher.
