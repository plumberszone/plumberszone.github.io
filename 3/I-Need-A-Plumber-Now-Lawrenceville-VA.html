<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits collect, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes.

If you wish to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
