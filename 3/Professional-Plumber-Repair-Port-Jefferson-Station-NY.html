<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
