<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes.

You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you desire to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
