That's why installation is best delegated professional plumbers who understand the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>Stegle says that when they are working with a customer on a custom home, they will work directly with the homeowner when it comes to selecting faucets and other components. As a subcontractor, those decisions may have already been made. We have actually established a group of contractors we've worked for in the past, and this has led to some service that has actually not included competitive bidding," Stegle says.</p>
