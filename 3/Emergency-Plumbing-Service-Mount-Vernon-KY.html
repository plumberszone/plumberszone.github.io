For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is simply capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (normally sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
