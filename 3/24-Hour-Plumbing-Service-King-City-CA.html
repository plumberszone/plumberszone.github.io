<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is just capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (usually salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
