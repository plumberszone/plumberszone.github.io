Constant feed disposals are simple to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of garbage disposal, however, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal debris can in some cases get captured in the blades. This can harm the blades and require repairs.</p>

Possibilities are good that the installing brackets on the new system will fit simply fine. To learn, eliminate the old disposal and install the brand-new flange on it. If it fits, you can install the new disposal using the old flange.</p>
