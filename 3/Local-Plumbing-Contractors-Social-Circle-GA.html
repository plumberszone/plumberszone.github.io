<p>The LAGBC is based upon the 2013 California Green Structure Standards Code, commonly called "CALGreen" that was established and mandated by the State to attain consistency amongst the various jurisdictions within the State; lower the structure's energy and water usage; minimize waste; and lower the carbon footprint. Constant feed disposals are simple to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of garbage disposal, however, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal debris can in some cases get captured in the blades. This can harm the blades and require repairs.</p>
<p>If your old sink flange is undamaged and tight, with no indications of leakage, you can probably leave it in place. Possibilities are good that the installing brackets on the new system will fit simply fine. To learn, eliminate the old disposal and install the brand-new flange on it. If it fits, you can install the new disposal using the old flange.</p>
