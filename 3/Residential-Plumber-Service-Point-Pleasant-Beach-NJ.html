<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back since he had another appointment. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have moderately tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>

<p>Recent Review: A journeyman plumber and his assistant shown up throughout the designated time period. They unplugged the sinks, cleaned up and advised a tool to be used in the future. How do you know if it's time to require sewer line repair or replacement? Look out for several clogged drains in your house, overruning or supported toilets, or water stains on your walls and foundation.</p>
<p>Repipers start by covering floors and furniture to protect them from water damage and dust throughout the work. They then find the pipes in your walls with little cuts into the drywall of the walls and ceilings. They will only get rid of as much building product as required to reach, detach, and remove the old pipe and replace it with new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To access pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, go in through the ceiling below it. If you wish, you can set up to have actually additional pipes put in at this time if you need to broaden your water service for a remodel.</p>
