<p>A lot of houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather defense. As the outer finish of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
