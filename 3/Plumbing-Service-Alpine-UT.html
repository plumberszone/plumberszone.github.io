<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return since he had another visit. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
