<p>Setting up a brand-new gas line in the kitchen will typically range from $300 to $800 depending on the length of the pipe needed. If you're converting your house to natural gas, or if the present line is at capacity, expect to invest $2,000 or more. New gas line expenses include appliance connections, shut-off valves, a gas meter, and connection of the gas to the main gas line in the street.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
