<h3>When To Call A Plumber Harrison AR</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>It's important to be mindful that a lot of scale and mineral accumulation in toilet bowls is caused by tough water if your problem is more related to scale and mineral accumulation. Hard water normally leaves lime and calcium accumulation which can become quite unpleasant. While phosphoric acid and other cleaning techniques will definitely assist, we strongly suggest you look into installing a water softener to assist with your hard water.</p>
