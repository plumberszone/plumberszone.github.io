Repeating repairs and leakages.

According to Sankarasubramanian et al., The typical per capita water use daily is higher in rural counties than city counties in all the climate regions, except in the Central and Southeast regions"1 with rural areas having less effective water supply systems2 mostly due to the relative absence of financial resources to upgrade and maintain their systems. So, the greater per capita consumption" of water in backwoods may consist of significant non-revenue water losses from their distribution pipelines. Such problems likewise factor into the need for backflow preventers at the points of use.</p>
