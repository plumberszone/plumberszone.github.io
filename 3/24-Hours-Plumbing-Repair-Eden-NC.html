Normally, minerals get there due to the fact that groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the residues travel with the water up until it is in your home. Water softening uses an ion exchange process to get rid of liquified minerals that aren't as successfully removed by mechanical filtration. These materials are what causes difficult water.</p>
