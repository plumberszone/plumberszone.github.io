<h3>New Baltimore MI 48047 Experts In Unclogging Drains</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, because I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the market and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>At Harry Clark Plumbing & Heating we focus on repiping for your home. Repiping is the process of replacing the cold and hot water lines in your Bay Area house.

<p>A cross-connection is any momentary or irreversible connection between a public water supply or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>Water heater service is often neglected, but your water heater is among the most crucial pieces of technology in your home. The best water heater can keep your baths and showers comfy, your meals clean, and your clothing washed-- all at a temperature level that works best for the soaps you're using. Shut off the water at the valves under the sink, and switch on the faucet to enable the water to drain. Make sure the drains are plugged to avoid small parts from falling in.</p>
