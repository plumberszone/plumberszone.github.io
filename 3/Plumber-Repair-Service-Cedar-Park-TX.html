<p>Some jurisdictions likewise enable options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>

Keep in mind: Batch-feed disposers do not require a switch since they begin when you place and turn an unique drain plug.
