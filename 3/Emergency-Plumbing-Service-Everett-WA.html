This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as tough water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
