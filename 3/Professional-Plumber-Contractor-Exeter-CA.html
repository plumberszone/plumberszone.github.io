<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>

<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals state, does not the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a regular event, but it does take place regularly than you believe! Often it happens during the night when you do not discover the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or hook up a new pipe. This makes construction projects quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common cause of backflow. Fire engine utilize big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
