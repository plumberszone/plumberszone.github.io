At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
