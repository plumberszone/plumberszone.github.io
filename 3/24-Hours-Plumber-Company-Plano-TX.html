Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
<p>There are fractures in the porcelain. If you see hairline or bigger fractures establishing in the bowl or tank of your toilet, it can lead to a leak.
