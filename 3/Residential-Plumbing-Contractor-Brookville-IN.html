<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have moderately tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
