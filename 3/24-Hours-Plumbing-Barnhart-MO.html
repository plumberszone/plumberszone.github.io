<p>Looking to repair or replace your waste disposal unit? Lots of blockages are triggered by putting too much bathroom tissue into the bowl.

Paper towels can quickly stop up the toilet drain line or cause a clog further down the drainpipe. Womanly health items need to be disposed of in the trash and never in the toilet.</p>
<p>To link a power cable to the brand-new unit, eliminate the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires discovered inside with their equivalents in the cable, utilizing wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the system. This can be done at any point prior to installation. Plumbing plans are not required for one- and two-family residences or townhouses, as defined in the California Residential Code, and their accessory structures.</p>
