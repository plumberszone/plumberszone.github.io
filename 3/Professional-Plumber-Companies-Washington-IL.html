<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have moderately hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
