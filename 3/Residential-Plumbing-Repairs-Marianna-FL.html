<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that permits water to go through it in one instructions, but avoids it from reversing in the opposite instructions. You might be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, simply put, the same thing, however without the zinc finish. The zinc coating on galvanized pipe for gas is indicated to keep the pipe from rusting from contact with moisture. While it does its task pretty well, over time, it still does corrode. This allows the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>

<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
