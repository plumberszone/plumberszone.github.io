<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and costly plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping.

<p>Once a large sufficient source of water has actually been determined and evaluated, the 3rd significant part of a water system system enters into play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its consumers. The largest of these main long-distance sending pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Typically built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable covering, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes created to bring bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. Most big cities need several aqueducts supplying water from geographically separated and varied sources.</p>

<p>In some neighborhoods, home water softeners drain to community wastewater treatment plants, which are not developed to eliminate chloride. The chloride travels through the treatment plant and winds up in our lakes and streams. In homes with private wells and house softeners, chloride drains to the house's septic tank and then winds up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions likewise permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, since every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
