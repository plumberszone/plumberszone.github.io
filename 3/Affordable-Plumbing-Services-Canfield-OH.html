<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners remove calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Simply put, soft water saves you money. Reduced Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes two independently acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and below the first check valve.</p>
<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows happen from them, these water functions are thought about a health threat. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area need to be suggested on construction plans. Any backflow preventer installed on a water fountain or garden pond need to be tested upon installation and after that each year.</p>
<p>As is the case with any plumbing device or water treatment system, your water softener should be expertly installed and serviced. This is the only method to guarantee that your system can deal with the need of your household, which it will in fact do the job effectively. Maintenance requirements are minimal, but it does pay to have the system checked for appropriate operation regularly.</p>
<p>Unless you have direct experience in the plumbing industry, enable a professional to deal with the installation. We'll send an experienced technician to your home when you call Pratt Plumbing. He or she will treat you with the utmost regard and courtesy. They'll address any concerns you provide and have guidance on the appropriate usage of a disposal system.</p>
