<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
<p>Most backflow preventers are developed to enable the elements to be gotten rid of for repair while the main body stays installed in the piping system. Removing the backflow preventer to repair it is not needed in many cases. Some elements such as relief valve bodies may need to be eliminated from the main body to facilitate a repair. Understanding the right order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>
