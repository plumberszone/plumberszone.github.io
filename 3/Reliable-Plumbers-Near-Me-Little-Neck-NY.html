<p>Repipers start by covering floors and furnishings to safeguard them from water damage and dust throughout the work. They then find the pipes in your walls with small cuts into the drywall of the walls and ceilings. They will only get rid of as much building material as needed to reach, separate, and eliminate the old pipe and replace it with brand-new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To gain access to pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, go in through the ceiling below it. You can arrange to have extra pipes put in at this time if you need to expand your water service for a remodel if you wish.</p>
