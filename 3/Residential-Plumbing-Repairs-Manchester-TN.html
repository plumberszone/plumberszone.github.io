<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
