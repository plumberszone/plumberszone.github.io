<p>Instead of drudging big trenches to access your underground sewage system, Roto-Rooter technicians will drill simply a few holes to see where the sewer line issue is and address it quickly. Call Roto-Rooter today to see if trenchless sewer line repairs are the ideal choice for your house or business.

Some small obstructions can be looked after with a plunger and typically, when the toilet won't stop running, it's a simple matter of replacing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank.
