This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather condition security. As the external finishing of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
