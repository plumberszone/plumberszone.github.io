We are now prepared to begin the re-assembly process. Some designs need the components to be gotten rid of in a specific order. These assemblies will also need the re-assembly in a specific order. Lots of parts can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are left open. As each component is put back into the body, it is necessary to put them back in the appropriate location. It is also crucial that as they are positioned back into the body, that no contaminant is connected on the components or accidentally placed in the body. The elements need to be put so that the guides have the ability to preserve their created tolerances.</p>
