<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the safe and clean water system and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is needed to be set up. An authorized, properly set up and preserved backflow assembly essentially eliminates the hazard of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Make sure that the softener is filled with sodium or potassium chloride following the producer's suggestions.</p>
<p>2. Demand-initiated softeners restore when they notice their softening capability is low as determined by a preset number entered by the user. The preset number represents the amount of time in between each regeneration. For example, a lower chosen number implies your softener will regrow less often. If you are experiencing stains, try choosing a lower number until you find one that satisfies your needs. Demand-initiated softeners are more popular and effective than time-initiated softeners.</p>
<p>You are accountable for fixing or changing the assembly within 30 days if your assembly stops working the yearly test. All replacements need to be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the right type of assembly based upon the conditions on your home (see area listed below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") In addition, the assembly should meet the lead complimentary requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the thirty days, all water services will be discontinued up until the assembly is in compliance.</p>
