<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your sewer line is one of the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes clogged or damaged, it could wreak undesirable issues on your home. A house's service line (also known as a sewer lateral) runs from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. In many cases, the homeowner is accountable for keeping the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is accountable for preserving the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>This is particularly true of older homes or company properties. If your pipes haven't been repaired, replaced, or checked in over a year, then you need to call us pretty soon. Routine maintenance is a fundamental part of keeping your plumbing running efficiently. Regular maintenance can help extend the life expectancy of your plumbing, components, and pipes perhaps by years.</p>

<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outdoors air.

This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
