<p>Water softeners add value to your operation by securing your water-using devices from poor performance and premature failure. Some difficult water problems are very visible, like sprayers and dispensers becoming clogged. Other problems can go undiscovered, like scale on water heater aspects and accumulation in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Noticeable or invisible, these problems have real expenses associated with them. Clogged components trigger replacement or refurbishing costs and can annoy your clients. Scale accumulation in your water heater will inflate your energy bills, and too soon damaged RO membranes will leave you with unneeded replacement expenses. Soon, these little expenses can add up to make a real influence on your bottom line.</p>
