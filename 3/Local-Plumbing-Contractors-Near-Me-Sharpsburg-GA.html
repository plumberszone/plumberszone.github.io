<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, which makes its plumbing's effective functioning a need more than a need. Ultraviolet disinfection systems utilize UV light to destroy micro-organisms and supply purified water. The cost is approximately the exact same for installing a propane gas line from the tank to the house as the cost to have natural gas run to the house.

<p>Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the potable water supply within a structure these devices are referred to as isolation" BFP. Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no chance to offer one, then we inspect to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
