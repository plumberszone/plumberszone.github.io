<p>Tough water use might impact the performance of household home appliances. When heated up, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the warm water heater. A large scale buildup slows the heating process and requires more energy to heat water. Water heaters with large build-ups of mineral buildup will have a much shorter life span. Scale deposits likewise collect to plug plumbing components and build up in other home appliances such as coffee pots and dishwashers, hence impacting their performance.</p>

The two kinds of pipes that we prefer to use for repiping are copper and PEX. These are 2 very various products, however they both have amazing resilience and durability.</p>
