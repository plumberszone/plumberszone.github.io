<p>Leakages are sly. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
