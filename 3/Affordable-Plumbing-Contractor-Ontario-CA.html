<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the general public water supply and private on-site supply of water and distribution systems by restricting cross-connections in between drinkable (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by requiring installation of secondary and main backflow prevention approaches.

Many have a neighbor who has actually had extensive water damage due to a leak and wish to avoid a similar incident in their house. Some people get tired of the rust in their water or low pressure.
