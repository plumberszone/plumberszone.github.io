<p>The issue of leakage can be credited to any number of elements which can range from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, along with poor maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank should have some room to account for the growth that takes place. The thermal growth needs to escape, hence the need for a growth tank to help manage the pressure. The force exerted by the expansion taking place when boiling the water causes the tank to split and begin leaking if the tank is old and used out. The treatment for this is to replace the water heater system.</p>
