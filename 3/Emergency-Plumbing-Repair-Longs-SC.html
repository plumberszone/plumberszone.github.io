When you have actually secured the journey lever and are ready to attach your flapper, make sure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you lower on the journey lever.</p>

Then they are changed in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
