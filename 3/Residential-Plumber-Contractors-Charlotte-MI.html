<p>Softer clothes without tough minerals caught in the fabric. Fabrics last longer and whites stay whiter without the dull gray triggered by difficult water.

<p>Pictures provided by the American Backflow Prevention Association. The cost to repipe a home with copper pipe is in between $8,000 and $16,000 or about $3 to $8 per direct foot. Replacing galvanized drain, waste, and vent pipe with copper expenses $13 to $15 per direct foot. Copper pipe is more costly than PEX, but it has some outstanding benefits.

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical solution is to have the faulty pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for lots of decades, but steel eventually experiences corrosion and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
