<p>Distribution pipes transition to even smaller private service pipes, bring water to private homes, home companies, structures and shops. Depending upon need, these pipes vary in size from a half inch in size to 6 inches.

<p>In some neighborhoods, home water softeners drain to local wastewater treatment plants, which are not developed to get rid of chloride. The chloride passes through the treatment plant and ends up in our streams and lakes. In homes with private wells and home softeners, chloride drains to the house's septic tank and then ends up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Set up 50 gallon electric hot water heater and thermal growth tank. When your drains are clogged, you will most likely start to observe gurgling sounds, water backing up into your sink or shower, or strange smells.
