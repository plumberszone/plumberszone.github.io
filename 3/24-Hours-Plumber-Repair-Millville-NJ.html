This is a type of plastic resin that was widely utilized by builders for homes integrated in the 1970s through the 1990s. The issue with this type of plastic piping is it can end up being brittle and break easily, especially if your water is chlorinated or chemically dealt with.</p>
<p>You also need to buy a backflow valve if you see your water has an uncommon flow, taste, color or odor.
