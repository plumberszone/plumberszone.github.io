<p>Finally, the most complicated and advanced backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five individually running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. Throughout standard water flows at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if costly) device is best utilized in vital locations where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
