<p>To link a power cord to the brand-new unit, eliminate the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires found inside with their counterparts in the cable, utilizing wire nuts.

<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on an established schedule and after that return to service. Since they regrow whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, typically regrow after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are practical if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
