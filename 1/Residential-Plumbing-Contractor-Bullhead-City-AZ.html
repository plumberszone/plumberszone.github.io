<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals state, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does.

No, it is not a frequent occurrence, but it does happen more frequently than you believe! Often it happens in the evening when you do not observe the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or link a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire engine utilize huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
