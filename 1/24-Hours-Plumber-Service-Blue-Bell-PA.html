<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and meet our rigid trust certification requirements.

Repairs are the right fix for problems such as missing out on or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small parts of the entire fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we recommend a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
