The predetermined number represents the quantity of time between each regrowth. For instance, a lower chosen number indicates your softener will regenerate less often. Attempt selecting a lower number until you discover one that meets your requirements if you are experiencing discolorations.

<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and then go back to service. These work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, generally regenerate after many gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are convenient if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
