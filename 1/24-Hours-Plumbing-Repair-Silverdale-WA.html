<p>Once a large sufficient source of water has been identified and evaluated, the 3rd significant component of a supply of water system comes into play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its customers. The largest of these main long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Generally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable coating, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes developed to bring bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines.
