<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each element. If the part is not repaired effectively, the guide might limit the motion (instead of direct or consistent) of the part, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
