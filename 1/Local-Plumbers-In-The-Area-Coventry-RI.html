<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on particular new sinks, however these will be identified to that effect. If you can't use plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel.
