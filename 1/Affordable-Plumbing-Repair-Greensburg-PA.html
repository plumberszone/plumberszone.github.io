<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Greensburg PA</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great guy. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, process) up front and provided as guaranteed. I will certainly use Clog Dawg again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be greater.</p>
