Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to several types of deterioration. After about fifty years, they'll start to damage from rust and might place toxic substances into the freshwater supply. We recommend replacing the steel, iron, and clay pipes in your home. This might not require completely repiping the house, because newer materials may have currently been utilized in some areas, such as the bathroom plumbing.
