<p>Weird Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is originating from your drain, it probably requires a comprehensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it tough for the water to go through.

This causes the water to bubble, as just little pockets of air are available, resulting in the weird noises originating from your sink.</p>
