<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal service is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in.

Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately experiences corrosion and does not have the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
