<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Assures? Bad Smells - If nasty odors are emerging from your drain, this is a clear sign your sink is not correctly draining water. Unpleasant stinks are a direct outcome of waste-build up in your drain piping. When this build-up collects, it can lead to more powerful odors, and more serious piping problems. Without practical draining, extreme pressure can cause your piping system to break and leak leading to expensive water damage.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
