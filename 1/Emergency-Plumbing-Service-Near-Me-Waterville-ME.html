<p>When compared to gas models, electrical designs are easier and more economical to install as electrical energy is currently readily available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a particular gas line has to be set up and a viable source of gas established. Another function of an electrical water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas models need to be aerated appropriately using vents and ducts in order to function properly. With electrical designs, you will not have to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your home.</p>
<p>You also need to invest in a backflow valve if you discover your water has an uncommon circulation, odor, taste or color. A plumbing professional can identify whether the problem with your faucet is a fast fix or the result of other issues in your home's plumbing system. More complex concerns with water temperature or pressure may require replacing the water heater, which usually costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capability and type.</p>
