<p>There are a variety of things that can go wrong with your sewer line. Like all pipes, the sewer line won't last permanently. It has been in place because your house was built so it has to do with the exact same age as your house. There are some things that can harm a sewer pipe such as freeze and thaw cycles and corrosion. Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when construction is being done at or near your house.</p>
