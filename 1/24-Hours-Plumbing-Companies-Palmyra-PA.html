<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems.

During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
