<p>When the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on extremely gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
