Go directly to a safe location in a close-by home or building, and after that call 911 and CenterPoint Energy at 1-800-296-9815 or 612-372-5050 instantly. Position the water softener. Ensure that the softener is correctly positioned. The inlet needs to be connected to the supply of water and the outlet must be facing the direction of the warm water appliances.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is small, but if you have actually been recommended by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can position problems.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention safeguards safe and clean water systems from potential hazards. There are over 10,000 reported cases of backflow contamination each year.
