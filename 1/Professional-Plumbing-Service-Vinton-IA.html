<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
