<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that must also be well maintained to help avoid leakages and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to solidify and split or simply be so squished that it does not fill the space along with it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so used or rusty that they spring a leak. We highly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
