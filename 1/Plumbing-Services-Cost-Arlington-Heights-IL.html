<h3>Frozen Pipes in Arlington Heights Illinois</h2>
<p>In some neighborhoods, home water softeners drain to local wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed to remove chloride. The chloride passes through the treatment plant and ends up in our lakes and streams. In houses with private wells and home softeners, chloride drains to the house's septic system and then ends up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Inspecting the water meter is a fantastic next step in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and check. There is a leak someplace and this could be major problem if it is. Move on to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When shut down, no faucet in the house should have water. This goes for every other turned off valve and their corresponding faucets. You are off to an excellent start if everything is working correctly.</p>
<p>Property owners can practice preventive maintenance to avoid future drainage concerns. Once a. month, utilize a plunger in your shower and tub drains to eliminate any stuck-on particles. Pour hot water with liquid soap down the drain, grind some ice and salt in the garbage disposal to eliminate grease. Another good technique is utilizing a drain strainer to stay out hair and soap scum from getting in your pipes.</p>
