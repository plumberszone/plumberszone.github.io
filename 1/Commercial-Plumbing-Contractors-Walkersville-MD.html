<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
