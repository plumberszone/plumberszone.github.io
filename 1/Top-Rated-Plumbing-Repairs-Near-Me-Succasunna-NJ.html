<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return because he had another consultation. A best bad plumber story.</p>
