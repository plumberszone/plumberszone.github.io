Plumber's putty can not be used on particular brand-new sinks, however these will be labeled to that effect. If you can't use plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
