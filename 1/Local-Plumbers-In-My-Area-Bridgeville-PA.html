<p>All you really need to do is (CAREFULLY!) when you have actually found the trip lever you desire remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Keep in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the correct method. When you've secured the journey lever and are prepared to attach your flapper, make certain you've got simply enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
