The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline prior to the problem worsened. Waiting simply wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a really costly option.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean supply of water. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
