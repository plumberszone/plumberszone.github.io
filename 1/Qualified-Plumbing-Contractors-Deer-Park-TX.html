<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
