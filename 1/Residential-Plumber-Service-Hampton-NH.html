<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and prevent it from working. This is known as fouling. Often it might be necessary to filter the water before it gets to your softener to avoid fouling. Commercial cleaners are readily available if the resin becomes fouled. Cleaners need to be used according to producer instructions to prevent contamination.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- usually salt. The outcome is water that's been successfully softened by removing nearly all traces of the minerals that make up difficult water.</p>
