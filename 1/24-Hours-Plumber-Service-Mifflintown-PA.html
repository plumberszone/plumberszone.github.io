<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Mifflintown PA</h3>
<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing blockage service may seem like a waste of cash. Why buy professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will do the trick? While chemical drain cleaners may be an economical solution, the extreme active ingredients corrode your inner drain pipe, in time, producing vulnerable points in the pipe that are likely to burst. Handling fixing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the savings incurred from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a feasible solution, specifically when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they typically consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your home and household.</p>

The auger or snake" is then utilized to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip helps require it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
