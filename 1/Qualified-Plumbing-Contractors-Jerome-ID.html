Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an appropriately working RPZ assembly to regularly release percentages of water.

Adequate drainage needs to also be provided.</p>
<p>Inspect the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and turn on the disposal to make certain it works. Check beneath to be sure there aren't any leaks.
