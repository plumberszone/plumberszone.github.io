<p>The secret to the technology is having the ability to control both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thus removing hardness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This innovation is more cost effective and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Commercial sink plumbing is more intricate than residential bathroom or kitchen sink plumbing.

<p>Hard water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water is available in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the solution by the salt ions.</p>
