<h3>Useful Tips for Water Heater Repair at Sylva NC 28779</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March said depending on the marketplace and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>

Brand-new gas line expenses consist of home appliance connections, shut-off valves, a gas meter, and connection of the gas to the main gas line in the street.</p>
