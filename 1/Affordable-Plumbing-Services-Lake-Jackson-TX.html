<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical solution is to have the defective pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an option to consider if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately suffers from rust and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
