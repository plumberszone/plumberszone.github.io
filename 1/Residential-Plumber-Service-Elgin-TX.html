<p>If your pipes are older than these standards, it does not necessarily imply they need to be changed. Properly maintained pipes may last longer, and poorly preserved ones or those in areas with tough water (suggesting it has high mineral content), may fail faster, states Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who supplied the lifespan estimates.</p>
<p>A Water Softener is a filtration system that works to eliminate high concentrations of calcium and magnesium that cause difficult water. When water streams through a Water Softener, the system removes these tough water minerals and the softened water then leaves the water softening system to stream through plumbing. State certified backflow service technicians, readily available through your turf watering company or plumber can figure out whether your equipment fulfills the requirements. The guidelines also need a state certified backflow professional test the backflow preventer every year.</p>
