For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to harden and split or simply be so squished that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the location.

Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly advise also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in good shape.</p>
