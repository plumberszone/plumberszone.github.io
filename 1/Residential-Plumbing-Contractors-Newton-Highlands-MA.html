<p>The problem of leak can be attributed to any variety of factors which can range from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, in addition to bad maintenance. The hot water heater tank need to have some room to represent the growth that occurs when heating the water. The thermal growth needs to escape, thus the need for a growth tank to help manage the pressure. The force applied by the expansion taking location when boiling the water causes the tank to split and begin leaking if the tank is old and used out. The solution for this is to replace the water heater unit.</p>
