Check Valve Assembly (DC): A DC is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes 2 separately acting, spring-loaded check valves.</p>
<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, enabling air to enter the valve and bring back pressure equivalent to ambient climatic standard. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
