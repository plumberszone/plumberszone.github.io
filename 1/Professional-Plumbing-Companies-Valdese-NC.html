<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day.

This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
