<p>Drawbacks to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid hot water heater need to be set up in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids need as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
<p>Lots of bad things are being said on this post about liners. I discover that lots of old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no hint on what they are stating. Because they don't like the technology and not since it does not work, will likewise say something does not work well merely. The piping procedure adds to the installation costs if this heater is set up in a house with multiple bathrooms.</p>
