<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and remove water particles from the solution with firmness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water particles for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is without hardness ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
