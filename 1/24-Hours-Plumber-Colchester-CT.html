<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each element. If the component is not fixed correctly, the guide might limit the movement (instead of direct or steady) of the part, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
<p>Pull the two lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the harmed fuel lines. A little cylindrical fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank when you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer.
