<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day.
