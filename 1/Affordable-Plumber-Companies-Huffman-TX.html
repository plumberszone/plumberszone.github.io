<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
