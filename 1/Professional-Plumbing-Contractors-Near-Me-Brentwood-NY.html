A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of a separately acting, spring-loaded check valve and an individually acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test dicks. A PVB might be used to separate health or non-health risks but is effective against back-siphonage only.</p>

Programs normally last four to 5 years and need apprentices to complete a particular variety of on-the-job training and technical education hours each year.</p>
