<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will collect in different parts of the plumbing system, the majority of typically in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can trigger low circulation problems or even stop a fixture from streaming entirely. The next common issue that occurs with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which occurs when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so severe that it lowers the offered volume of water that can stream around the system.</p>
