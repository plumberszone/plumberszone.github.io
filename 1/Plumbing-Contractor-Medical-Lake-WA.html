<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

<p>Climatic Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is among the least costly backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable system and benefit back siphonage just for non-health risk or health threat conditions. They need to be set up downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should also be installed at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local officials, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not permit the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can just secure against back siphonage.</p>
