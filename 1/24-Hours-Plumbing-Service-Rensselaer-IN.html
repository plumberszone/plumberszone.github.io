<p>Leak detection is a component of water conservation that counts on highly technical know-how and specialized equipment to recognize the area of leakages throughout the city's water circulation system and identify the place of those leaks at which noticeable water might or might not have surfaced. Water temperature level concerns can be repaired by adjusting the temperature on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be brought on by a blocked aerator screen. House owners can just loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can also be low.</p>

When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that detergent savings increases to almost 70%.</p>
