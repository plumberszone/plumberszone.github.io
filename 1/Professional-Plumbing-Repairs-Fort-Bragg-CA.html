<p>Finally, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water flows at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if costly) device is best utilized in important locations where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
<p>A well-trained plumber would not suggest a replacement unless the original toilet was broken beyond repair, even if that is the case they might recommend moving toilets to various bathrooms to lessen any future stoppages.
