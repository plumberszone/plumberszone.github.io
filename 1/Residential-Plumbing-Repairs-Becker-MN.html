<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. No warm water in your house? Is your water taking too long to warm up? Is your hot water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your house? If you have any of these problems, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs and even a replacement.

<p>A continuous-feed waste disposal unit is the most common type which continues to run as long as the power switch is on. A continuous-feed disposal is best for combating large amounts of food waste. Many garbage disposals are plug-in, as it is much safer to have a vibrating system come unplugged then detached from stationary wiring.
