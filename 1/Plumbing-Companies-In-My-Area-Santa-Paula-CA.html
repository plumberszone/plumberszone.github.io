<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Santa Paula CA 93060</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
