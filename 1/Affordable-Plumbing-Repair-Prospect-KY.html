Throughout regeneration, salted water from the salt water tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank.

The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific new sinks, however these will be labeled to that impact. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in location. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
