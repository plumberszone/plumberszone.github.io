<p>If you're living with decreased pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and unlimited appliance repair expenses, you need a water softener.

Your circulation rate will continue to restrict and you run the risk of losing water pressure throughout the house if scale continues to collect in your pipes. Difficult water ravages hot water heater, and without a softener, your utility bills will continue to barrel skyward. If your water supply is hard, the continuous cycle of repairs and replacements will continue up until your home is safeguarded by a water softener.</p>
