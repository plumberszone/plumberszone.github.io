<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in most cases it must be much less water.</p>
