When your water lines are repiped, it simply suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes.

If you have an older home and are experiencing significant and frequent leakages, you might be in need of water line repiping. We find that repiping can actually be the less expensive and much better long-lasting solution if you do have regular leakages.</p>
