New assemblies should be evaluated by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report need to be provided to us. Get cleaner clothes, remove rust areas, and use less cleaning agent when you soften your laundry water. Whole-house designs are suitable for washing machines, or you can try laundry additive water softening items.</p>
