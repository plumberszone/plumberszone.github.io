<p>The Required Inspections Table shown below lists those inspections that need to be performed to validate that your work adheres to the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Regulations. Please note that Virginia's Building regulations prohibits the use of any plumbing fixtures or devices prior to approval of all needed inspections. We hope this list is advantageous to you throughout the course of your project. Please call our Building Inspections Department, at 804-501-4360, if you have any concerns about what is required for each inspection or if you need help scheduling an inspection. Building, Electrical, Mechanical or Fire Protection work require extra licenses and inspections. Separate notices are readily available to describe the inspections required for each type of license.</p>
<p>Demand loads, no matter what their use, should be met by a sufficiently sized water supply, which makes up the 2nd major component of a supply of water system. With sufficient storage tank capacity to fulfill variable peak load demand, the supply of water source can supply a steady flow of water. Throughout hours of low demand, the water flow can be used to fill up storage tanks, tanks and towers, which then supply water for emergency usage and durations when demand exceeds the standard pumping rate. A supply of water source can take numerous types, consisting of groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, natural or manufactured ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you desire to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
