Some elements may have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is a very critical part of the style of each component. If the element is not fixed effectively, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the part, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities.
