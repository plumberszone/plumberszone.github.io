If your plumber needs an authorization to repair the gas leak, which they'll most likely have to perform in the Atlanta metro area, the fees to pull the authorization will add to your repair cost. Although the lifespan of your house's pipes differs due to a wide variety of aspects (including wear and tear and whether or not you live in a cold-weather climate), a great general rule is to replace them if they are 50-years-old or older.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you have to employ a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair costs might be in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Choose the brand-new heater.</p>
