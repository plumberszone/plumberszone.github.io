These flanges are widely available and simple to install, costing around $30 in the house improvement or hardware shops. Switch off the water system to your house at the main line. To avoid leakages from springing throughout the installation procedure, shut off the supply of water to your home. Make sure your water heater's water supply is switched off, as is the electrical power running to the unit.</p>
