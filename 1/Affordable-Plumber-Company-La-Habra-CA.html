<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An important thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each component. If the part is not fixed effectively, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or steady) of the component, which might trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
