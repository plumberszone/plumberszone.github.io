<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

Kirby Water Conditioning happily offers consumers in Eastern Iowa and Western Illinois with Hellenbrand water conditioners and softeners to put an end to difficult water mineral deposits once and for all.
