<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable supply of water. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
