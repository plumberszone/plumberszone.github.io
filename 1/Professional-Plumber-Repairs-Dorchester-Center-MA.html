<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your house. When you experience clogs in multiple drains at the same time in your home, then that normally indicates that your main sewer line is backing up. This can happen in multiple places and any combination of drains. For instance, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from several drain lines in your house.</p>
<p>One of the most expensive devices in your home is your hot water heater. This unit is constantly running to keep the water warmed in your house for when you need it. The water for the shower, sinks, washing machine and dishwasher need to be hot instantly, and that is why it is so crucial to have your heater preserved and fixed when problem develops. The group at Johnson Heating & Cooling Inc can set you up with a maintenance strategy so that we are closely monitoring your heater prior to difficulty occurs.</p>
