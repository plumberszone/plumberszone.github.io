<p>Protect your house from leakages. When you need a water heater replacement, there are several things that you should consider to help you decide. A great general rule of thumb is that once your present hot water heater reaches its 10th birthday, you need to start getting ready for a replacement. At this age, you will understand that it is nearing completion of its usefulness so this is a good time to start looking at your replacement choices. This way you won't have a surprise expenditure on your hands when the day comes that it quits working.</p>
<p>Then connect the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if relevant).
