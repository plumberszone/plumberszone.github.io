<p>Some pipe products are less expensive than others; some are more fragile and susceptible to cracking, displacement or other types of structural failure. Other materials are susceptible to deterioration and rust while some are unaffected. Specific pipe materials have greater coefficients of heat pressure, making them more susceptible to structural tensions and stress as a result of temperature change and ice development. And these distinctions determine the potential need for backflow preventers.</p>
<p>A Water Softener is a filtration system that works to eliminate high concentrations of calcium and magnesium that trigger tough water. The system filters out these difficult water minerals and the softened water then leaves the water softening system to stream through plumbing when water streams through a Water Softener. State certified backflow professionals, offered through your grass irrigation company or plumber can identify whether your equipment satisfies the requirements. The guidelines also require a state certified backflow technician test the backflow preventer yearly.</p>
