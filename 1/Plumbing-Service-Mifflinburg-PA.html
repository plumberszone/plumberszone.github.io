<p>Leakages are sneaky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften difficult water.

Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.
