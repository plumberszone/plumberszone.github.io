<p>Leakages are sly. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>Finally, the most complex and sophisticated backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 individually operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. Throughout standard water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if expensive) device is best utilized in important locations where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
