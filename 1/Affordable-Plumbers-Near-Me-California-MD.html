<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and fulfill our rigid trust certification standards. A good guideline is to replace faucets that show deterioration, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Run-down and rusted parts make repairs expensive and hard, indicating a faucet installation is more beneficial. Repairs are the appropriate fix for concerns such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small elements of the whole fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we recommend a new faucet installation.</p>
