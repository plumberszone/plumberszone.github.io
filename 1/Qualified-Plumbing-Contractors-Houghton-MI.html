The GFAVB is a non-testable system and benefit back siphonage just for non-health risk or health hazard conditions. They need to be installed downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must likewise be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local authorities, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet).
