<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are installed in areas where water could trigger catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>Tankless electrical water heaters can be found in two types. There are whole-house heaters that are powerful and big enough to supply hot water to all bathrooms, kitchens, and appliances in a home. On the other hand, there are the point-of-use electric heaters that provide hot water to particular spaces or appliances only. Both whole-house and point-of-use heaters work the exact same method. The only difference is the amount of water they can warm up at any provided time. Also, whole-house systems are considerably more expensive than the point of usage units.</p>
