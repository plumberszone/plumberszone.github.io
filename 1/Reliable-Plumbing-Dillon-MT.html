<p>Some pipe materials are less expensive than others; some are more brittle and prone to cracking, displacement or other kinds of structural failure. Other materials are susceptible to corrosion and rust while some are unaffected. Specific pipe products have higher coefficients of heat pressure, making them more vulnerable to structural tensions and pressures as an outcome of temperature change and ice formation. And these distinctions dictate the potential need for backflow preventers.</p>
