<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are set up in locations where water might cause devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and areas with electronic devices.

Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
