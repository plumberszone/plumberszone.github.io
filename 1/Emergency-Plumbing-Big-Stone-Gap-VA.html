<p>Backflow preventers are also needed by the plumbing code. Except within Coastline, the plumbing authority for Seattle Public Utilities clients is King County plumbing (Public Health - Seattle & King County).

<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on particular brand-new sinks, but these will be identified to that effect. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. When you tighten up the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Ensure to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, enabling air to restore and get in the valve pressure comparable to ambient climatic standard. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
