<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber Clinton CT</h3>
<p>You can unwind and use your gas piping without any concern when we handle your gas or gas pipe installation and gas pipe repair. While water overuse is a concern for your wallet, it's also an issue for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can use up to 25 gallons of water every day for their regrowth process. That's 700 gallons of water a month simply to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Tree roots can be a significant factor in impacted sewer lines. Tree roots grow in many different directions and can get large triggering intrusion of the lines underground. Another reality is that tree roots search for water sources and will follow the source leading them directly to sewer lines eventually growing right into them and triggering major sewer line problems.</p>
