<p>Backflow is the undesirable turnaround of flow in a safe and clean water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can just flow in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will constantly stream towards the point of least expensive pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water pipe could drop. The demand upstream might trigger a reversal in flow.</p>

<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the blockage with negative pressure, it in fact pushes into the blockage, working even more into where the obstruction is happening.

<p>The problem of leak can be attributed to any number of aspects which can vary from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, in addition to bad maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank must have some room to account for the expansion that takes place. The thermal growth needs to escape, thus the need for an expansion tank to assist regulate the pressure. The force exerted by the growth taking location when boiling the water triggers the reservoir to crack and begin leaking if the tank is old and worn out.
