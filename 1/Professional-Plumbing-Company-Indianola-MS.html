<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Indianola MS 38751?</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March said depending upon the market and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>Any home appliance that uses water, from little coffee pots to large refrigerators, operates more efficiently in a house with softened water. This is because there's no limescale accumulation to interfere with moving heat or clogging pipes. Improved efficiency also indicates that you'll delight in a decrease in your energy expenses, as your appliances will not need to work more difficult or utilize more water in order to operate at their best.</p>
<p>While a DIY toilet replacement is definitely possible, it's likewise simple to screw up. And when you mess up a toilet installation, you can end up with big problems: Leakages, ruined floorings, wetness in floor substructures and walls-- serious and expensive problems. Unless you're really experienced, it's best to trust a professional for replacing a toilet.</p>
<p>Testing should be completed by a contractor signed up with the Cross Connection Control office. The contractor should possess a valid, up-to-date plumbing license, current insurance, backflow preventer testing certification, and currently adjusted test package. For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is required.</p>
