<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Anthony TX 79821</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March said depending upon the marketplace and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
