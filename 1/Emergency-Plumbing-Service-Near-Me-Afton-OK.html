<p>Surprise water leaks are frequently stressful and have Potentially Major Consequences. When it rains, any excess water is supposed to go down a storm drain in order to prevent flooding problems.

If a clogged storm drain is not dealt with in a prompt way, the opportunities are high that it will cause extra damage to the storm pipe, which will require repair.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
