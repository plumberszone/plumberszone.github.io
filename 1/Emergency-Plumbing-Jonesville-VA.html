In severe cases, hard-water deposits can drastically restrict the water flow, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>

Summertime is typically a greater need duration than winter season given that individual usage of water increases with garden, heat and lawn watering, recreational pools, and so on</p>
