<p>Please let EBMUD know of any scenario that may require a backflow device. In some cases conditions on residential or commercial properties change that may require a backflow device, such as dealing with a boiler with additives or setting up a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a hassle for your company, they can cause monetary losses and in some instances can stop your business totally. For restaurants having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be devastating. Even in a small office the issues caused by even little drain problems can cause significant issues.</p>
<p>The normal solution is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many decades, however steel ultimately suffers from deterioration and lacks the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
