<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on certain brand-new sinks, but these will be identified to that effect. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
