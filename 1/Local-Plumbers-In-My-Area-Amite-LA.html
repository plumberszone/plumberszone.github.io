Whole-house models are suitable for washing machines, or you can attempt laundry additive water softening products.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer system determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth instantly starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regeneration usually takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
