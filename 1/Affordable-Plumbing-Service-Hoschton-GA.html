<p>No other room in a home consists of as lots of pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. When changing an under-sink assembly, look for quality materials. Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any setup, together with flexible rubber traps. Debris can easily catch in this type of piping while the piping's flexible nature does not offer needed support for the drain basket. PVC assemblies are an excellent choice s they can be easily connected to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make sure it sets prior to testing the drain.</p>
