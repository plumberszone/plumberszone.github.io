<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back.

<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to collect your lawn. Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images caught by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have moderately tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
