Black iron pipe is, simply put, the exact same thing, but without the zinc finish. The zinc covering on galvanized pipe for gas is meant to keep the pipe from wearing away from contact with wetness. While it does its task quite well, gradually, it still does wear away. This allows the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
<p>Another obligation of the Plumbing Division is to carry out cross connection inspections to identify safe and clean water systems that require being protected from contaminates.

<p>Lastly, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 separately operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. During basic water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed.

That repair expense is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Choose the brand-new heater.</p>
