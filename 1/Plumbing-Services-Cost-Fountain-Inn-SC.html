<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Fountain Inn SC</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede versus the needed direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. There is potential for the polluted water to become a health hazard if enabled to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for effectiveness, as well as inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
