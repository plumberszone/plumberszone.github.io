The largest of these primary long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Generally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable coating, these are big underground and aboveground pipes created to bring bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. A lot of big cities need a number of aqueducts providing water from geographically separated and varied sources.</p>
