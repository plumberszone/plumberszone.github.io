WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
