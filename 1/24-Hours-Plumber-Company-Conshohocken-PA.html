<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and remove water molecules from the solution with hardness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water molecules for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is without solidity ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter needing regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
