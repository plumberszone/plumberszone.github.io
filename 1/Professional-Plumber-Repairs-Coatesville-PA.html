<p>Leaks are sneaky. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>As soon as a big adequate source of water has been identified and examined, the 3rd significant part of a water supply system enters into play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its consumers.

Normally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finishing, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Many big cities need numerous aqueducts supplying water from geographically apart and diverse sources.</p>
