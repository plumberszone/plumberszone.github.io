<p>Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close effectively. When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
