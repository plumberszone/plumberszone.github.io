<p>Though water line replacement seems like your house's equivalent of significant surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it just means old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older house and are experiencing regular and significant leaks. If you do have regular leaks, we find that repiping can really be the less expensive and much better long-lasting option.</p>
<p>It's quite common for particles to wind up being flushed down our drains. Consider how frequently food particles, cooking oil and hair ends up in our sinks and showers. After sufficient time, these items might build up into obstructions, which can block the flow of water throughout a house. This can result in several problems, from nasty stinks to water leakages and burst pipes.</p>
