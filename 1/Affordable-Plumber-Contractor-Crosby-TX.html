<p>No other room in a home contains as many pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. We now have actually cleaned and examined the components parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their components, cleaned up the body and the seats and flushed the inbound water line. We are now all set to start the re-assembly procedure. Some models need the components to be removed in a specific order. These assemblies will also require the re-assembly in a particular order. Many parts can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are exposed. As each part is returned into the body, it is essential to put them back in the appropriate area. It is likewise important that as they are placed back into the body, that no contaminant is attached on the parts or mistakenly positioned in the body. The components need to be placed so that the guides have the ability to maintain their developed tolerances.</p>
