<h3>Drain Cleaning in Columbia TN 38401 : What You Need To Know?</h3>
<p>These valves have a great deal of versatility. They're the least costly of the backflow prevention choices, however they also offer the least quantity of protection. An atmospheric vacuum breaker, also called an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a floating disc. This disc seals and increases off the air inlet when pressurized and drops to allow air to go into the downstream piping when depressurized.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems typically are installed in large, unheated locations, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is launched, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
