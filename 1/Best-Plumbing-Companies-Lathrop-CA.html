<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water.

So, relatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
