<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these aspects are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
