<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to a climatic vent.

This sets off the disc to open, enabling air to enter the valve and restore pressure comparable to ambient climatic requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
