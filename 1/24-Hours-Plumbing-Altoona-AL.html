<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on three different occasions, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our professionals and they were fantastic. They rapidly discovered the leak and repaired it without making a huge mess.

<p>You can use a wire coat wall mount by correcting it if you don't have a plumber's snake. Obviously, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it may be long enough to reach some obstructions. Insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or take out the clog if you can reach it. Beware not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
