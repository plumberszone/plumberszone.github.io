<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on 3 different celebrations, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our professionals and they were fantastic. They rapidly found the leak and fixed it without making a big mess.

<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts must be removed and changed with new rubber parts. It is very important that just original factory repair parts are used when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to utilize and changing the rubber from the initial factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
