<p>Video cameras are one of the most important tools in the plumbing company. Figure out the size of the water pipes in the house and around the home - they will assist to identify the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be appropriate, the lines must be 3/4" to one inch straight from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves need to be at least a 1/2" in size to supply appropriate flow.</p>
<p>Then connect the drain (and dishwasher hose, if appropriate). If your system is outlet-ready-- take notice of this part-- make certain your disposal switch remains in the off" position prior to you plug the new system in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal launch while your head is pressed against it will lead to decapitation, it might frighten a number of years off your life.
