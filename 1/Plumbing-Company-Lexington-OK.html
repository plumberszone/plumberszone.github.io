<p>Downsides to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
