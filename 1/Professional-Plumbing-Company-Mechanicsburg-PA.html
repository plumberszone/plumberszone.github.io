All assemblies must be safeguarded from freezing temperature levels and if installed where temperature levels will reach 100 degrees F or above, a warm water type assembly need to be used.

When searching for plumbing services in the area, be specific with your requirements and ask candidates if they are licensed plumbers and if they have the advanced experience and licenses connected with a plumbing contractor.</p>
