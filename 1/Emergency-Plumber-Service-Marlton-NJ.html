This device includes no less than five separately running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water flows at style pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline.

Such a reliable and advanced (if pricey) device is best used in crucial areas where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
