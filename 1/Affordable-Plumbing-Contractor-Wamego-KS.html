Generally, minerals get there because groundwater will dissolve rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the residues travel with the water up until it is in your home. Water softening uses an ion exchange procedure to get rid of liquified minerals that aren't as efficiently eliminated by mechanical filtration. These materials are what causes difficult water.</p>
