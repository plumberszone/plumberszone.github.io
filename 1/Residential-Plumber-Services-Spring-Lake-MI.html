<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is an extremely critical part of the style of each element. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than steady or direct) of the part, which could trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
