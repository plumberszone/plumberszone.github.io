<p>Drawbacks to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heat pump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids need as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product coated with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
