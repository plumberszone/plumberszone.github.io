The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
