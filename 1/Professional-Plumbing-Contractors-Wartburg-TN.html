This makes building and construction projects quickly the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
