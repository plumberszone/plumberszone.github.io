<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions must have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers.

Much of the most recent faucets include a pull-down sprayer, however if that is not to your taste, be sure to include a different sprayer.</p>
<p>To eliminate the smells, initially try pouring BioSmart (available at WJ McNabb Plumbing) down your drain. You can likewise attempt 1 cup lemon juice down the drain.
