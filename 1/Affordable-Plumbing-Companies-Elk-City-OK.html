<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Elk City OK 73644?</h3>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
