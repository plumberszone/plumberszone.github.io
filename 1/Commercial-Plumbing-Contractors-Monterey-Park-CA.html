<p>Once a big enough source of water has been determined and evaluated, the 3rd major part of a supply of water system comes into play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its customers. The biggest of these main long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Generally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable covering, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes created to carry bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Many large cities need several aqueducts providing water from geographically apart and varied sources.</p>

<p>Lastly, the most sophisticated and complex backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five independently running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water flows at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if expensive) device is best used in vital locations where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
