<p>Two styles of PVBs are offered: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and an individually acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test cocks. A PVB may be utilized to separate health or non-health risks but is effective versus back-siphonage just.</p>
<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows take place from them, these water functions are considered a health danger. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location must be indicated on building and construction strategies. Any backflow preventer installed on a water fountain or garden pond should be evaluated upon installation and after that yearly.</p>

In most cases, we replace the damaged element to prevent leaking or rust.
