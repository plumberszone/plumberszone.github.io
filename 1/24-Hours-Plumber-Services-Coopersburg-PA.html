Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is generally made from aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank.

<p>Lots of property owners will see a clog and immediately reach for a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner.

Destructive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, specifically in areas where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main reason for the blue and green discolorations being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks.</p>
