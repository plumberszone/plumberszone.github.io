Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
