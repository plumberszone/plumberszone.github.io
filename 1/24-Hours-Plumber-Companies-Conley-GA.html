Standing or ponding water from leaking sewer lines are also a health risk and regularly go undiagnosed. Leaking drain pipes can also weaken your drain system and trigger separations. Because the source of leaking water can be hard to detect, our plumbers typically carry out a dye test to pinpoint the source.
