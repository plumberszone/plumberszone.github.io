<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. Since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however most of the times it should be much less water.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent occurrence, but it does take place more often than you think! Typically it happens during the night when you don't observe the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or link a new pipe. This makes building and construction projects quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding areas.</p>
