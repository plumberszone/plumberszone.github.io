<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
