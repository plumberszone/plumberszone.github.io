<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
