<h3>How To Keep Bathroom Sinks Running Smoothly in Palo Alto CA 94303</h3>
<p>Water hardness is the quantity of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The factor you can feel the distinction on your skin is due to the fact that soap reacts with the calcium to form soap scum. This results in the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. And that's where the term solidity" originated from ... it's difficult to wash in.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove particles such as hard water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>
