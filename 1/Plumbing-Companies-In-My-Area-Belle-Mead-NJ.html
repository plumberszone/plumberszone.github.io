<p>Physical strength. Steamfitters, plumbers, and pipefitters need to be able to raise and move heavy tools and products. Pointer: Place a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving throughout installation. Loosen the clamp and get rid of the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Trying to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the issue, as the pipes are weakening slowly from the inside. In most cases, repiping is your only viable choice.</p>
<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by aligning it. Obviously, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some blockages. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
