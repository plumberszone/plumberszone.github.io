Bear in mind that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the correct way. When you have actually protected the journey lever and are all set to attach your flapper, ensure you've got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
