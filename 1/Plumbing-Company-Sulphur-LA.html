<p>The usual solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many decades, but steel eventually struggles with rust and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
