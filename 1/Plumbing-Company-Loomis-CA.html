<p>Odd Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is originating from your drain, it most likely needs an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it hard for the water to pass through. Because of the tight space, the pipes often make odd gurgling sounds as water efforts to travel through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are available, leading to the unusual noises originating from your sink.</p>

An extermination company worker had actually left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other connected to an external house hose bibb (outdoors spigot).
