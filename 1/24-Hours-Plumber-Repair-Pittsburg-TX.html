<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
