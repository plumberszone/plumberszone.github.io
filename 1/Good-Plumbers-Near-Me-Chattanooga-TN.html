<p>We need to clarify a little terminology before we proceed with a backflow prevention assembly repair. A backflow prevention assembly consists of an inlet and outlet shut down, appropriately located test cocks, and the required components of the assembly (check valves, relief valve or air inlet). Each part can even more be broken down into its parts. For instance a first check is a component. A part can even more be broken down into its specific parts (check discs, springs, disc holder etc). Backflow parts are put together to make components, and parts are put together to make a backflow prevention assembly.</p>

<p>The simplest method to keep you and your family safe from the prospective dangers of backflow through cross connections is to not create cross connections in the very first location. However, if you do have a cross connection to a sprinkler system system, boiler, pool, water function or other kind of cross connection, have actually an authorized backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
<p>In fact, reverse circulation testing developed to ensure that backflow preventers prevent backflow was eliminated from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA acknowledges that backflow stays a genuine health issue, it considers preventing it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Instead, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will make sure that backflow preventers are effectively checked by certified personnel.</p>
