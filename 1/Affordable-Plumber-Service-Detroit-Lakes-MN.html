<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede versus the required direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the contaminated water to become a health risk if permitted to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for effectiveness, as well as inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
