For instance, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from cars and truck cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might get in the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development may stream backwards into the safe and clean water system.
