<p>Last but not least, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 independently operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. Throughout standard water streams at style pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if costly) device is best used in vital locations where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
