<p>You will have the ability to ask for the date and time of the inspection on the TSE permit application. The LADBS application need to be submitted and paid for at least 2 (2) company days prior to the date of the occasion, AND, after you have acquired all other needed approvals or clearances from all other firms. Waste disposal unit can be made from either aluminum or stainless steel. Aluminum is more economical but more susceptible to leaking and deterioration. Stainless-steel blades are also more resilient. People with a septic system will need to talk to the septic tank installer or producer to learn which garbage disposal models are compatible with their system.</p>
