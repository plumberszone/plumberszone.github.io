<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair at Farmingdale NJ 07727</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
