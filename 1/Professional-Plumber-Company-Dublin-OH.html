<p>When compared to gas models, electric models are easier and more economical to install as electrical energy is currently available through the main power supply line. For gas hot water heater, a particular gas line has to be installed and a viable source of gas developed. Another function of an electrical hot water heater is that they do not need any ventilation.

<p>Passive Purge - Approximately 2007, some houses were enabled to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of one or more toilets in the home. Generally, the water system to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each use, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual option is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to think about if you live in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many years, however steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
