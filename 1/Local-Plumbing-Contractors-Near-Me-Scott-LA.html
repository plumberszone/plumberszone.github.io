<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back against the needed instructions of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can become polluted. If permitted to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for efficiency, as well as inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
