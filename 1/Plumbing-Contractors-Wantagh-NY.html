There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure variations and disc compression that could result in incorrect information on the functions of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can result in extreme pressure spikes that might damage elements. The effects of raised temperature level can also cause extreme pressure conditions which might damage the parts in the elements. These and other negative results from the hydraulic conditions should be acknowledged and their cause remedied. If parts are replaced and the hydraulic conditions are not corrected, the new parts can soon be made inoperative.</p>
