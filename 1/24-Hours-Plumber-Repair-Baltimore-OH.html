Then, a brand-new installing ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is connected to its mount. In this approach, water is treated with a calculated quantity of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get precipitated.</p>
