We now have actually cleaned up and inspected the components parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their parts, cleaned the body and the seats and flushed the inbound water line.

<p>You might have heard stories about a warm water heater blowing up inside a house or business! It is essential to understand that a plugged temperature level and pressure relief valve on your hot water heater can turn your hot water heater into a dangerous time bomb. The age of your water heater. A standard tank hot water heater generally lasts anywhere from 8-12 years prior to requiring a replacement, while a tankless hot water heater can last approximately 20 with proper maintenance and care.
