The best method to prevent drain blockages is to watch what you flush. If you look at your home's plumbing pipes and see stains, staining, flaking, small indentations or rust, your pipes are corroding. Rusting pipes are more likely to spring a leak (if they haven't currently) and ought to be replaced as quickly as possible.</p>
