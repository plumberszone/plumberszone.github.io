<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
