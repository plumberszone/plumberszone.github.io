<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however for the most part it must be much less water.</p>
<p>An evaluation of the hydraulic conditions present at the assembly need to then be assessed. There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure fluctuations and disc compression that might cause false data on the functions of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can cause severe pressure spikes that could damage components. The results of elevated temperature level can likewise cause extreme pressure conditions which could damage the parts in the components. These and other negative impacts from the hydraulic conditions should be acknowledged and their cause corrected. The brand-new parts can quickly be made inoperative if parts are replaced and the hydraulic conditions are not fixed.</p>
