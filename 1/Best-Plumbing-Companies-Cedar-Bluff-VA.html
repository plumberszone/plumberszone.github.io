When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being polluted. If enabled to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health threat. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for efficiency, as well as inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
