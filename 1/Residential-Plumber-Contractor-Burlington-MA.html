Generally, minerals get there because groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants take a trip with the water up until it remains in your house. Water softening uses an ion exchange process to eliminate dissolved minerals that aren't as effectively eliminated by mechanical filtration. These products are what triggers hard water.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
