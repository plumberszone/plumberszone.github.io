It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the salt, or salt, is kept and combined with water. If you prepare to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate intact if you will not utilize your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>
<p>Non-precipitating water softeners are now based upon polymer type active ingredients such as salt polycarboxylate. Faulty Components: If your toilet will not stop running, it's most likely due to problems with a toilet tank component. In such cases, we are usually able to replace that single component.
