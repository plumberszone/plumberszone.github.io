Howard, the Task Supervisor, has actually always been useful and informative relating to all our issues. He did the proposal and arranged the work for the clean out and partial sewer line repair immediately. It is constantly a pleasure to deal with him. Derek snaked the laundry line and outside kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He was able to get a snake around the "Y", which many plumbers state they can't do, and clear the line. He is always pleasant, professional and goes above and beyond.</p>
<p>Mounted under the sink, the garbage disposal is suggested for slicing up small bits of waste food.

<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is saved and combined with water. If you plan to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not use your unit to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate intact.</p>
