<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each element. If the part is not repaired effectively, the guide could limit the motion (rather than consistent or direct) of the component, which could trigger the component to not work to its capabilities.
