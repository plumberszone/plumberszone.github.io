<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Joshua Tree CA 92252?</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one ought to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
