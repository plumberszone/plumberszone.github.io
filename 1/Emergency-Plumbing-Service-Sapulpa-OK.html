<p>Your sewer line is one of the most essential parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being clogged or damaged, it might wreak unwelcome problems on your home. A house's service line (also known as a sewer lateral) ranges from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. For the most part, the homeowner is responsible for keeping the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>A garbage disposal lasts an average of 10 to 12 years. This average lifespan estimation presumes typical wear and tear of the system.
