Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, but these will be labeled to that impact. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel.
