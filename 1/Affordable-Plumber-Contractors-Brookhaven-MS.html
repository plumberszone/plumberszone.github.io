It is important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to make sure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close appropriately.
