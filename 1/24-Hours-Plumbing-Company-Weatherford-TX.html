<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the clog with negative pressure, it really pushes into the blockage, working even more into where the obstruction is taking place. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip helps force it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
