<p>Backflow is bad news.

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this boost can position problems.</p>
