<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Ventura CA</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
