<p>It's Making sounds - As your water warms, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will cause it to work more difficult and can produce sound. If your energy expenses are rising, a new, higher effectiveness water heater can bring them pull back. All that has to be done is blocking the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, enabling hard water to stream to the tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, relocated to its brand-new location and placed there.</p>
