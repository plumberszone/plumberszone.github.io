<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the salt, or salt, is kept and mixed with water. If you plan to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not utilize your unit to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate intact.</p>
<p>Corrosion: The most common problem is deterioration in the tank and pipes that connect to your hot water heater. This is specifically true if you have untreated difficult water, which consists of extreme minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the product over time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another component that is triggering the rust, you will ultimately experience a leak in your water heater that is tough to repair. Leaks frequently imply a new system replacement is in order.</p>
<p>As is the case with any plumbing appliance or water treatment system, your water softener must be professionally installed and serviced. This is the only way to ensure that your system can handle the demand of your household, which it will in fact do the job effectively. Maintenance requirements are minimal, but it does pay to have actually the system examined for proper operation frequently.</p>
