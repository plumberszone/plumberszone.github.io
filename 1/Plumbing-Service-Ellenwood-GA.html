<p>Sewer lines have one important function: bring wastewater out of a house or structure. Although these homeowners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline before the issue worsened. Waiting simply wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been a very costly option.</p>
