<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as hard water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
<p>Physical strength. Plumbers, steamfitters, and pipefitters must have the ability to raise and move heavy tools and products. Tip: Place a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving throughout installation. Loosen the clamp and eliminate the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Attempting to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are deteriorating gradually from the inside. Most of the times, repiping is your only practical alternative.</p>
