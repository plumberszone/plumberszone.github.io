<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Rock Island IL</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily trigger countless dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel method off schedule. So hiring a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers deal with all types of work. Their tasks break out into two categories: Plumbers who manage standard repairs (frequently in emergency situations), and plumbers who specialize in remodeling additions and tasks.</p>
