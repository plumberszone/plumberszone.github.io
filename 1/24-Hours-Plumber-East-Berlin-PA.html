<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
