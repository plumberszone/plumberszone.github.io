<h3>How To Keep Bathroom Sinks Running Smoothly at Exton PA 19341</h3>
<p>Water solidity is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the difference on your skin is due to the fact that soap responds with the calcium to form soap scum. This leads to the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. Which's where the term hardness" originated from ... it's tough to clean in.</p>
