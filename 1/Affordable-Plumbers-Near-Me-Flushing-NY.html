<h3>Fix A Leaking Water Pipe at Flushing NY 11355</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
