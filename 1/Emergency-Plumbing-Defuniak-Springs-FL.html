<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Defuniak Springs FL</h3>
<p>It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a correctly functioning RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in areas based on water damage. Adequate drainage needs to also be provided.</p>
