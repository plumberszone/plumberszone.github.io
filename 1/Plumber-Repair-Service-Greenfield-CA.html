<p>We focus on storm drain inspections and cleaning. A lot of kitchen sink blockages are due to heavy grease buildup and food particles.

Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. Throughout basic water streams at style pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if pricey) device is best utilized in critical locations where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
