<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. No warm water in your house? Is your water taking too long to heat up? Is your hot water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your home? If you have any of these problems, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs and even a replacement. While some of these concerns can be credited to normal wear and tear or inappropriate installation, sometimes your waste disposal unit becomes harmed by items that shouldn't be gone through it.</p>
<p>These types of hot water heaters are normally powered by natural gas because it is more cost-effective to power them with gas than with electrical energy. Gas water heaters cost more than electrical hot water heater to install initially, but wind up costing about half as much to run - conserving you substantial quantities of cash on your utility bill in the long run.</p>

The most popular and traditional style of hot water heater in Boston and surrounding Massachusetts's communities is a gas or electrical tank system.

<p>Check the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and turn on the disposal to make sure it works. Inspect below to be sure there aren't any leaks. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of appropriately. Pipes made from galvanized steel are no longer used in brand-new houses, however many houses developed in between the 1930s - 1980s still have them. Galvanized steel pipes need to be removed by a professional plumber when discovered and replaced with another pipe material.</p>
