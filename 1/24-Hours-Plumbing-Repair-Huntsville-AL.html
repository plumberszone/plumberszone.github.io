For example, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from automobile washes; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler may go into the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray advancement might flow in reverse into the safe and clean water supply.
