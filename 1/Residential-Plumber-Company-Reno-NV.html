<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
