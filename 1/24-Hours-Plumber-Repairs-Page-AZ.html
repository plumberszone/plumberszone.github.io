<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material covered with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Repipers start by covering floorings and furniture to secure them from water damage and dust during the work. They then locate the pipes in your walls with little cuts into the drywall of the ceilings and walls. They will only get rid of as much building material as necessary to reach, separate, and eliminate the old pipe and replace it with brand-new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To gain access to pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, enter through the ceiling below it. If you want, you can arrange to have additional pipes put in at this time if you need to broaden your water service for a remodel.</p>
