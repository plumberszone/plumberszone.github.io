<p>Physical Damage: Water tank and hot water heater repair from physical damage such as cracks or leaks are also common occurrences. Kenny came out and did an incredible task unclogging my storm drain. He identified the issue and had the ability to come back and jet it out. Saved me the time and cash of ripping all of it out and changing it. He provided ideas to assist in the future, was extremely professional, and will be utilized once again if need be. Highly recommended.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can lead to improper drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
