<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits take place more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe.
