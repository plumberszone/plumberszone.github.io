<h3>How To Fix Burst Water Pipes Bowling Green MO</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>The Albuquerque Water Authority offers rebates for installing low flow toilets, urinals, and low circulation showerheads. High effectiveness, low circulation toilets utilize 1.28 gallons per flush and urinals utilize much less water. Older toilets could be flushing approximately 5 gallons per flush!
