<p>When you have actually found the journey lever you want, all you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Remember that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the right method. When you have actually protected the trip lever and are all set to attach your flapper, make certain you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
