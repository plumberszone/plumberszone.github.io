<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and pricey plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire home repiping.

If scale continues to accumulate in your pipes, your circulation rate will continue to restrict and you risk losing water pressure throughout the house. Tough water devastations water heaters, and without a softener, your utility bills will continue to barrel skyward. The perpetual cycle of repairs and replacements will continue until your home is safeguarded by a water softener if your water supply is hard.</p>
<p>A well-trained plumber would not recommend a replacement unless the original toilet was broken beyond repair, even if that holds true they may advise moving toilets to different bathrooms to decrease any future blockages.
