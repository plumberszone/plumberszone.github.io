<p>A Water Softener is a filtration system that works to get rid of high concentrations of calcium and magnesium that cause tough water.

State certified backflow service technicians, offered through your turf watering company or plumber can determine whether or not your devices satisfies the requirements. The policies also require a state certified backflow professional test the backflow preventer every year.</p>
