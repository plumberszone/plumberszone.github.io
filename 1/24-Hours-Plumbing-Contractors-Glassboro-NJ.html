<p>Backflow preventers are critical for producing a safe water system system. Because they're less vulnerable to rust, stainless steel blades are normally chosen. Other great choices are overload security, which switches off the motor if it starts to overheat; an auto-reverse feature to avoid jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the unclean dishes get ground up in the disposal.

<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
