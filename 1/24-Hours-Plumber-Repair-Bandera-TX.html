<h3>How To Repair A Leaking Kitchen Faucet in Bandera TX 78003</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March said depending upon the market and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
