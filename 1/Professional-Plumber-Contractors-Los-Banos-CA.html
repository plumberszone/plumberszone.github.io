<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
