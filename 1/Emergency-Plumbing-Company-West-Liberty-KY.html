<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back because he had another consultation. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
