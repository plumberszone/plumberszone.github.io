<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Sewell NJ 08080</h3>
<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- destructive. For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is just catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (normally salt or often potassium).</p>
