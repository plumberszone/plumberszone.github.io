If your toilet won't stop running, try repairing or replacing these essential toilet parts.</p>
<p>Particles such as foreign items - Things such as soap, hair, food and even little toys can become trapped in between your drain and your pipes.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back since he had another visit. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
