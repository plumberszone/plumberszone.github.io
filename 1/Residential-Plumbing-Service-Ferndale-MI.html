<p>As soon as you've found the journey lever you want, all you actually need to do is (CAREFULLY!) eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that due to the fact that of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the proper way.
