<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in Chesterfield MO 63017</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
