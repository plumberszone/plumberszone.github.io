<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and remove water molecules from the option with hardness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water particles for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is devoid of hardness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
