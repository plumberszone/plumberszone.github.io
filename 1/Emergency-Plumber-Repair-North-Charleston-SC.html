<p>Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on extremely slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be examined to guarantee no valves were mistakenly exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>

<p>Pro Tip: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the unit, now is the very best time to eliminate the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet till the plug is broken off; obtain the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer.
