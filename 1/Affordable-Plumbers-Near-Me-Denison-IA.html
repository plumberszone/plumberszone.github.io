Some components might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a very crucial part of the style of each element. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide might limit the movement (instead of stable or direct) of the element, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
