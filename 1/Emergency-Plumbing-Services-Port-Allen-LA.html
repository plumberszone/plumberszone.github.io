<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Port Allen LA</h3>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your lawn. Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images recorded by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have moderately tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>

<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the salt, or salt, is kept and combined with water. If you prepare to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not utilize your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate undamaged.</p>
