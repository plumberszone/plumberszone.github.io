<h3>Why Plumbers Are So Expensive Lewisville NC</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>The Albuquerque Water Authority provides rebates for setting up low flow toilets, urinals, and low circulation showerheads. High efficiency, low circulation toilets utilize 1.28 gallons per flush and urinals utilize much less water. Older toilets might be flushing as much as 5 gallons per flush! Refunds of up to $100 are available for low flow toilets. This might offset the majority of the cost of the toilet depending on the model you select.</p>
