<p>A sewer leak on your drain line, or main sewer line, can be difficult to spot and can also harm your home. Ponding or standing water from leaking sewer lines are also a health hazard and often go undiagnosed. Leaking drain pipes can also undermine your drain system and trigger separations. Our plumbers typically perform a dye test to pinpoint the source because the source of leaking water can be tough to spot. Frequently, pipes or water service lines are replaced, just to find they were not the source of a leak. Suprisingly enough, sewer water is not always dirty or blemished and often gets incorrect for a supply of water line leak.</p>
<p>In truth, reverse circulation testing designed to make sure that backflow preventers prevent backflow was eliminated from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA acknowledges that backflow stays a legitimate health concern, it thinks about preventing it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Instead, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will make sure that backflow preventers are correctly evaluated by qualified personnel.</p>
