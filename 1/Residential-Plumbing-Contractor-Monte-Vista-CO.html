<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Monte Vista CO</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
