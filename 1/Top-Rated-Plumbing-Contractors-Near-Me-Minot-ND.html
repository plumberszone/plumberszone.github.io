At that time, people had no concept that the lead in the pipes might leach into the drinking water, let alone the health hazards associated with lead.</p>
<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, heater, and boiler, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits.

In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can considerably limit the water flow, which puts excessive pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>
