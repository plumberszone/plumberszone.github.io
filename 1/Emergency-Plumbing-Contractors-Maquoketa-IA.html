<h3>How to Repair Kitchen Faucets in Maquoketa IA 52060</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
