<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- destructive. For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is merely recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (typically salt or often potassium).</p>
