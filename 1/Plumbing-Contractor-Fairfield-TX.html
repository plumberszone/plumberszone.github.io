<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
