<p>It's Making Noise - As your water heats up, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom. This will cause it to work more difficult and can create sound. If your energy costs are increasing, a brand-new, higher efficiency water heater can bring them back down. All that needs to be done is blocking the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, allowing hard water to stream to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, relocated to its new place and put there.</p>
