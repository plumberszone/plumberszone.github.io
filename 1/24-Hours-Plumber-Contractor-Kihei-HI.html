<p>Galvanized piping is responsible for at least half of the plumbing emergency situations that we face in the houses around the Bay Area. The preliminary concerns that take place are the staining of the water, with brown water coming out of a faucet that might have a nasty smell. It can also cause spots in clothes put in the washing machine. If your house is over 50 years old, it's a great bet it's time to replace the plumbing, at a minimum cost of $2,000 and an optimum of $15,000. The wide disparity in rate is due to the size of your house, the kind of pipe you're setting up, and extra repairs you find you need to make whenever you go behind walls.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
