You may have an idea of where your lateral is located if you have actually had plumbing service prior to planting. If you do not know, spend the minimal cost to have a professional plumber find the lateral for you so that you do not make the mistake of planting over, to close, and even dig into and break the line.

Your line will be simple to identify if you have a clean-out.</p>
