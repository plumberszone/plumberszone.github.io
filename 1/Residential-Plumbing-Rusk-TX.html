<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>It's a strangely intricate clinical process, but easy to correct. It uses salt to get rid of smells and minerals discovered in tough water- most typically calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems utilize resin beads that attach and draw in sodium ions in the softener tank. Pumps push difficult water through the resin beads exchanging solidity ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
