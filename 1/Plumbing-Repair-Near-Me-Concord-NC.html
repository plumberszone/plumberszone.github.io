<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a range of products were used for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these products are resilient in the short-term, they weaken over years.

After about fifty years, they'll start to deteriorate from rust and may place contaminants into the freshwater supply. We recommend changing the iron, steel, and clay pipes in your house. This might not require completely repiping the house, since newer materials might have currently been used in some areas, such as the bathroom plumbing.
