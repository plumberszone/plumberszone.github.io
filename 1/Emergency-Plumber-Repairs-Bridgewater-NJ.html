<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber In Bridgewater NJ</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it does not grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Attempt releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal.
