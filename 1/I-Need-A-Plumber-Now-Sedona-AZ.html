<h3>Blocked Drain Cleaning: Why Hire A Professional in Sedona AZ 86336?</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that rates were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March stated depending upon the market and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>

<p>Polybutylene utilized inside your house can be found near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets.

You may have to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
