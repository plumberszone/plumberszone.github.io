We have 300% more chemicals that go beyond national health guidelines, and a even high portion of toxins in our water that the national average. On top of that our typical water solidity level is in between 18-23 grains per gallon of water or for simpleness factors "really difficult water".</p>
<p>Check to make certain it's not your waste disposal unit that's triggering the issue. A clogged disposal can stop up the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog.
