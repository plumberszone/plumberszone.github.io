Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
