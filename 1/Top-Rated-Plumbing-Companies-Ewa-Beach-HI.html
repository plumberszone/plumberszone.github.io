If however, you begin smelling something foul coming out of your drains or around your house, there could be a crack somewhere in your sewer line.</p>
<p>This is specifically true of older homes or organisation homes. If your pipes have not been fixed, changed, or examined in over a year, then you need to call us quite quickly.
