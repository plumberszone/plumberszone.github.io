<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits take place more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you desire to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
