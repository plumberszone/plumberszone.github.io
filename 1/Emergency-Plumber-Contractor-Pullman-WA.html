<p>No other room in a house consists of as many pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. We now have actually cleaned up and inspected the components parts, replaced the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their parts, cleaned the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now ready to begin the re-assembly procedure. Some models need the elements to be removed in a specific order. These assemblies will also require the re-assembly in a specific order. Many elements can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are left open. As each element is put back into the body, it is very important to put them back in the proper area. It is also essential that as they are placed back into the body, that no foreign matter is attached on the components or unintentionally put in the body. The parts need to be placed so that the guides have the ability to maintain their designed tolerances.</p>
