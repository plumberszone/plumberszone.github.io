<p>Difficult water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>Tankless electrical water heaters been available in two types. There are whole-house heaters that are powerful and large enough to provide hot water to all bathrooms, cooking areas, and devices in a home.

The only distinction is the amount of water they can heat up at any offered time. Also, whole-house units are significantly more costly than the point of use units.</p>
