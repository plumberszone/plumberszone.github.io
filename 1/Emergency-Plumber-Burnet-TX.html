<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a very vital part of the style of each component. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than steady or direct) of the element, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
