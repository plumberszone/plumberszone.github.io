As it gets used, it can begin to split and solidify or merely be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space in addition to it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so worn or rusty that they spring a leak.
