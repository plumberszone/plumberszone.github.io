<h3>Why Plumbers Should Install Water Heaters in Mims FL 32754?</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months ago. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March stated depending on the market and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
