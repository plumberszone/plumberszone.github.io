<p>Blending vaporized salt with rock salt is not recommended, as this could clog the softening reservoir. It is suggested that you allow your system to go empty of one type of salt prior to including another to prevent the event of any problems.

One method to test for any leakages in your plumbing is to turn off all water devices in your home and outdoors (sprinklers, hoses, etc.). Then locate and enjoy the numbers on your home's water meter. If the numbers increase after 20-30 minutes, you have a leak. And the faster those numbers go up, the larger the leak.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to present a chemical substance that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water rather than developing on surfaces. However, if they stay in one location for long, as they may in a water heater, the accumulation might still take place.</p>
