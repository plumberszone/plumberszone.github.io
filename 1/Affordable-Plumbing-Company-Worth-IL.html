<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each part. If the component is not repaired effectively, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of direct or stable) of the component, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
