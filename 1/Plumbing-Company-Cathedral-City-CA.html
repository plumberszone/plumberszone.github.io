<p>These are all signs that your unit ought to be checked by a plumber. We do not recommend attempting to repair this particular device on your own, due to the fact that it does provide a safety danger, due to the sharp blades that are used to grind and chop waste. You ought to also prevent using any type of chemical drain cleaners on your garbage disposal since these chemicals will only damage the device further.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>You can utilize a wire coat wall mount by correcting it if you don't have a plumber's snake. Of course, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it might be long enough to reach some clogs. Insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
