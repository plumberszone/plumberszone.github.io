<p>6. Install the new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, called P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your house. Plumbers can replace or fix blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them functioning properly. Leaking pipes can impact your indoor air quality. Call today at (979) 200-6674 to have your plumbing examined and we will let you know if a repipe in Brenham is right for you.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no nearby utilities or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining could save you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
