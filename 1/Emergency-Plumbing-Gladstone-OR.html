<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Gladstone OR</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
