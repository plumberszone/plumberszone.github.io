When your water lines are repiped, it simply means old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We discover that homes 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement.

If you do have frequent leaks, we find that repiping can really be the less expensive and better long-term option.</p>
