<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a range of materials were used for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are long lasting in the short-term, they weaken over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to many different kinds of deterioration. After about fifty years, they'll start to weaken from deterioration and may place toxins into the freshwater supply. We recommend changing the iron, steel, and clay pipes in your house.

<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and after that return to service. Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles however will waste more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, generally regrow after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a changing water utilize schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
