<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
