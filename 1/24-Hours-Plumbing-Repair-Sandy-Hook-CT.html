<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return because he had another appointment. A best bad plumber story.</p>
<p>The majority of backflow preventers are created to allow the parts to be gotten rid of for repair while the main body remains set up in the piping system.
