<p>Sewer lines have one vital role: carry wastewater out of a home or structure. Although these homeowners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was definitely excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline prior to the issue worsened. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been a very expensive option.</p>
<p>Then attach the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if suitable).
