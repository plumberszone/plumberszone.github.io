<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain new sinks, however these will be labeled to that result. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
<p>The majority of need for plumbers will come from brand-new construction and the need to repair and keep plumbing systems in existing houses and other structures.
