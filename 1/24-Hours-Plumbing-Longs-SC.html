<p>The key to the innovation is having the ability to manage both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, therefore removing hardness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief innovation officer. This technology is more cost reliable and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Quit working orders shall be used to halt work that is figured out to be contrary to arrangements of the Uniform Code, or is being performed in a harmful or risky  way, or is being carried out without acquiring a required authorization. A stop work order shall specify the factor for its issuance and the conditions which should be satisfied prior to work will be allowed to resume.</p>
