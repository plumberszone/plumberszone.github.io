Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an effectively functioning RPZ assembly to occasionally release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in locations based on water damage. Appropriate drainage should also be offered.</p>
