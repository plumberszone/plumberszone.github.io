<p>It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an effectively working RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge percentages of water.

Sufficient drainage should also be supplied.</p>
