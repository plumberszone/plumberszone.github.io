That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other devices. Even your water lines ought to be covered.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have moderately difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
