<p>When you have actually found the journey lever you want, all you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the correct method. When you've secured the journey lever and are all set to hook up your flapper, ensure you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
