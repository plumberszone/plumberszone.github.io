<p>Seattle Public Utilities checks backflow assemblies upon installation and performs regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies must be evaluated by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report should be supplied to us. Get cleaner clothing, get rid of rust areas, and utilize less cleaning agent when you soften your laundry water. Whole-house models are proper for washing machines, or you can attempt laundry additive water softening products.</p>
<p>How much is a sewer line inspection? These specialized evaluations include specialized camera equipment that faces your sewer line. A camera inspection is much more tasty than trenching through the backyard if you have actually identified pooling water in the yard. This will cost you (on average) in between $300-$ 400. Master plumber licenses are granted to plumbers who have actually held a journey license for a specific amount of time, and have accumulated the required hours working as a licensed journey plumber. In addition, a master plumber also needs to pass a state sanctioned test.</p>
