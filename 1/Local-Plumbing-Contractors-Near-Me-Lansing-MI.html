Constant feed disposals are simple to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste.

Next, ensure the drain compression seal is seated appropriately in the drain locknut, then tighten the drain and reinstall locknut. Last but not least, turn on the water and test for leaks.</p>
