<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks in Trenton MO 64683?</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March said depending on the market and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>Gas lines are a wonderful, more affordable energy alternative for home owners and commercial property owners alike. This has made gas lines more common and improvements in technology have made the harnessing of natural gas relatively safe. However, gas lines are among the most forgotten functions to a house or organisation and yet, among the most important. If left unattended, they can also become the most harmful and unsafe.</p>
<p>If there is a leak, we will find the leak and shut the gas line down at the main line if it has actually not already been completed. Then, our technician will dig to discover the gas line and leak. The gas line will be changed and pressure checked to guarantee there are no leaks. The website will be cleaned up and brought back to its previous elegance if the leak is properly repaired.</p>
