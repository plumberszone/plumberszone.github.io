Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

<h3>Need A Plumber Service Venice CA</h3>

The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
