<p>It is very important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a correctly working RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in areas based on water damage. Adequate drainage should likewise be offered.</p>
