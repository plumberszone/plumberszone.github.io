<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors East Hampton CT</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Leaks - Next, leaks represent the most common cause for kitchen sink repair. Normally, they begin little and go undetected, and after time can result in big puddles underneath your sink and cabinets. This type leads to possible water damage. Most other kinds of leaky kitchen sinks which are annoying however are generally fixed quickly. Connection concerns between the faucet and water supply line or sprayer hose, and missing gaskets between the faucet and sink are huge wrongdoers. Worse may be rust in the pipes that must be replaced.</p>

This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure.
