<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In North Salt Lake UT</h3>
<p>Minerals in water are what makes certain water considered hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most common minerals discovered in water. Usually, minerals get there since groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants travel with the water up until it is in your home. Water softening uses an ion exchange process to get rid of liquified minerals that aren't as effectively gotten rid of by mechanical filtration. These materials are what causes tough water.</p>
<p>That is an indication the tank is stopping working and will need to be replaced if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. If it is in a garage and a little slow leak, schedule a price quote as soon as possible and ensure nothing is near the heater that could be possibly harmed. Leaking water heaters can burst triggering water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
