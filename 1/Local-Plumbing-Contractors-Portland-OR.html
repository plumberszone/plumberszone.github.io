<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. Because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in many cases it should be much less water.</p>
