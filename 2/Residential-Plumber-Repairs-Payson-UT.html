<p>This is another combination that can work on sink clogs. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and put down the drain. Let the mixture sit for numerous hours, then flush with boiling water. If it doesn't work the first time, you can duplicate this procedure. Galvanized steel pipes are perfect for watering and supply of water lines, but they are usually not utilized in new building and constructions today. It is most likely to be discovered in older homes constructed prior to the 1970s.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure.

The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
