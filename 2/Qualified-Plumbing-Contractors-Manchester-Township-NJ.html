Hard water ruins appliances, leaves filmy soap residue across restrooms and kitchen areas, and dries hair and skin.

State certified backflow technicians, offered through your grass watering company or plumber can determine whether your equipment satisfies the requirements. The policies likewise require a state certified backflow specialist test the backflow preventer yearly.</p>
