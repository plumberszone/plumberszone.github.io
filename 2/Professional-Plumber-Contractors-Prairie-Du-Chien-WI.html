<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at Prairie Du Chien WI 53821</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March said depending upon the market and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions must have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water features are considered a health danger if backflows take place from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and place should be suggested on building plans. Any backflow preventer set up on a fountain or garden pond should be evaluated upon installation and after that annually.</p>
<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it does not grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck. Attempt freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>When your sink is surrounded by granite, marble, quartz, and others, the material can get harmed in time.
