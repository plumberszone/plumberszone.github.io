<p>Backflow preventers are important for creating a safe water supply system. Due to the fact that they're less prone to rust, stainless steel blades are generally preferred. Other excellent options are overload defense, which switches off the motor if it starts to overheat; an auto-reverse feature to prevent jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the dirty dishes get ground up in the disposal. And if your home is on a septic tank, you'll need a disposal particularly created to be utilized with a septic system. gives an overview 1 of garbage disposals and septic tanks.</p>
