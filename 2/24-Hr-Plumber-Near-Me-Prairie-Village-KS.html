<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits build up, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes.

If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
