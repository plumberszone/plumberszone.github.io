<p>Water solidity is the amount of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. Due to the fact that soap responds with the calcium to form soap scum, the reason you can feel the difference on your skin is. This leads to the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. And that's where the term firmness" came from ... it's difficult to clean in.</p>
<p>Disadvantages to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids require up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
