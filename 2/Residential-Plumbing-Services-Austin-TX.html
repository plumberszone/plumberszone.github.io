<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
