<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
