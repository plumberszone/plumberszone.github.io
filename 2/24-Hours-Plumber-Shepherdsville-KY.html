<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems usually are set up in areas where water might trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and areas with electronic devices.

Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
