<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- basically 2 layers of security.

There are 2 different types of testable backflow prevention devices that are typically defined-- a minimized pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device. There are a few others that I will mention but do not get hung up on them. Because they will be on an accreditation test, I mention them just.</p>

<p>Dual Check Valve - Design GF8080, GF8080E - The Dual Inspect Valve or double backflow prevention valve is generally a disrobed Check Valve without turned off valves and test cocks. They are non-testable and are usually used by water companies and installed after a water meter to avoid the meter from running in reverse and low security versus backflow. This tool is the center of debate with lots of backflow authorities and must never ever be confused with Double Check Valves.
