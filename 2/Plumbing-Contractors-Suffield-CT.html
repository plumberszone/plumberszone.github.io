<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. No warm water in your home? Is your water taking too long to warm up? Is your water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your home? If you have any of these concerns, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs and even a replacement. While some of these concerns can be credited to regular wear and tear or inappropriate installation, often your waste disposal unit becomes harmed by products that shouldn't be gone through it.</p>
<p>Particles such as foreign things - Items such as soap, hair, food and even small toys can become trapped in between your drain and your pipes. These will ultimately obstruct the flow of your water before triggering a clog. Likewise, if excessive toilet tissue is flushed down your toilet, or hygienic products are flushed, a clog can happen.
