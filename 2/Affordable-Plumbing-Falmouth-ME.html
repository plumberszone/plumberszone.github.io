<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank don't always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if necessary. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might need to increase or decrease the vent size to ensure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>

Due to the fact that it is unappetizing and odor-free although it is very harmful, it is challenging to find carbon monoxide. Since breathing in carbon monoxide leads to poisoning and in some circumstances death, you need to guarantee that your plumbing is done expertly.

<p>The Required Inspections Table revealed listed below lists those inspections that should be carried out to confirm that your work complies with the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Regulations. Please note that Virginia's Building regulations restricts using any plumbing fixtures or equipment prior to approval of all needed inspections. We hope this list is advantageous to you throughout the course of your job. Please call our Structure Inspections Department, at 804-501-4360, if you have any questions about what is needed for each inspection or if you need help scheduling an inspection.
