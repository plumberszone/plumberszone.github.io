Nevertheless, lots of people wait up until the drain stops completely before they take corrective action. Call us before your problems get this bad. We promise it'll save you money and time in the long run.</p>
<p>The issue of leakage can be attributed to any number of factors which can range from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, along with bad maintenance. The water heater tank must have some room to represent the growth that takes place when heating the water. The thermal growth requires to get away, thus the need for a growth tank to help regulate the pressure. If the tank is old and broken, the force exerted by the expansion happening when boiling the water causes the reservoir to split and begin leaking. The remedy for this is to replace the water heater system.</p>
