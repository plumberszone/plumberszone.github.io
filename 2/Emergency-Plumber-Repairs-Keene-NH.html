<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have really tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is an extremely important part of the style of each part. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide could limit the movement (rather than direct or consistent) of the part, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
