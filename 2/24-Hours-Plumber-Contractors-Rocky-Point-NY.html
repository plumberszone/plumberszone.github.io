<h3>Why Do You Need a Drain Cleaning Service in Rocky Point NY 11778?</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending on the market and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>But is a plumbing catastrophe imminent or just an issue for the long run? Replacing old pipes in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom home costs $4,000 to $10,000, and needs cutting open walls and floorings, so you certainly don't want to get the job done prior to it's needed. Here's how to evaluate your plumbing system and understand when it's time for replacement.</p>

<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are mostly time associated. If whatever is prepared, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or more of time. If things need to be customized, changed, or relocated to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and therefore the total costs. Many plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with many disposal installations running $50 per hour for 3 hours overall, making the labor costs approximately $150.</p>
