<p>Many house owners will notice a clog and right away reach for a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner. While this kind of chemical may get the job done, it's really quite harmful to your pipes. Chemical drain cleaners typically use lye as the active ingredient. Lye is designed to eat through obstructions and liquify them, however it also penetrates your pipes and produces weak points that are vulnerable to burst.</p>

Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material.

More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this boost can position problems.</p>

<h3>Drain Cleaning in Huntington NY 11743 : What You Need To Know?</h3>
<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is simply capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (usually sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>

<p>The normal option is to have the faulty pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to consider if you live in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for numerous years, but steel eventually suffers from rust and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
