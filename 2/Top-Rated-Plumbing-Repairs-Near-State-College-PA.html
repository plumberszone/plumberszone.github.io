<p>Leaks are tricky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a process called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
