The cost of products for a grounded outlet will likely cost between $5 and $10, and $120 to $165 to hire an electrician If your installation requires a brand-new switch, expect to spend an additional $5 to $10 on materials, and $50 for labor.</p>
<p>To link a power cord to the brand-new unit, get rid of the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires discovered inside with their equivalents in the cable, utilizing wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the unit. This can be done at any point prior to installation.

<p>Dual Inspect Valve - Model GF8080, GF8080E - The Dual Examine Valve or double backflow prevention valve is generally a disrobed Check Valve without shut down valves and test cocks. They are non-testable and are generally used by public utility and set up after a water meter to avoid the meter from running backwards and low protection against backflow.
