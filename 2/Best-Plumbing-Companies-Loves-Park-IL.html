<p>Minerals in water are what ensures water thought about hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most common minerals found in water. Normally, minerals get there because groundwater will dissolve rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants take a trip with the water until it remains in your house.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have moderately hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
