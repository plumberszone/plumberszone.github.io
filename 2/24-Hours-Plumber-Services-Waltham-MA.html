<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a variety of materials were utilized for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are durable in the short-term, they deteriorate over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to several types of corrosion. After about fifty years, they'll start to weaken from deterioration and may position contaminants into the freshwater supply. We suggest changing the iron, clay, and steel pipes in your home.
