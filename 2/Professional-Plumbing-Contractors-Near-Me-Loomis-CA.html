<p>When you count on Roto-Rooter for hot water heater maintenance, repair or replacement, you can expect professional service from experienced plumbing professionals. Backflow prevention devices operate by enabling water to flow in just one direction. In an unguarded water service connection, potable water can stream both in and out of a building or component. When water service is interrupted in the street or in a structure for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw polluted water in reverse into the water supply. For example, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from vehicle washes; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might go into the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development may stream in reverse into the drinkable water supply.
