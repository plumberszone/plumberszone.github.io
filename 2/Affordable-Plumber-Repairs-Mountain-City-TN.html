They should be installed downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It needs to also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet).
