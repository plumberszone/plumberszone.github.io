<p>Doctor Fix-It is Denver's source for a professional toilet repair or replacement service. The entire house has polybutylene plumbing.

<p>Plastic pipe remains in broad use for domestic water system and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not become practical to produce till 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. established a technique to plasticize PVC, making it simpler to process. PVC pipe started to be produced in the 1940s and was in wide use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping throughout the restoration of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics makers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The approach for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was likewise developed in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have ended up being progressively typical, with a range of materials and fittings used.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal service is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is a choice to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of years, however steel eventually experiences rust and does not have the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
