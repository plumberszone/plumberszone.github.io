An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a brand-new pipe. This makes building jobs quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding communities.</p>
