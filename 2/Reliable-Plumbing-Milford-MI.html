<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular event, but it does occur more frequently than you think! When you don't notice the water was off for a few minutes, frequently it happens at night. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a brand-new pipe. This makes building jobs quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding communities.</p>
<p>If you turn on your house's water spigots and water begins draining with a yellow-colored, brownish or reddish tint, that's a clear sign that rust or sediment has developed in your pipes and a repiping job must remain in your near future.
