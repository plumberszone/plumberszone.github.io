<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to determine on each component is the guide.

If the component is not fixed correctly, the guide could limit the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the element, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities.
