<p>As soon as a big sufficient source of water has been recognized and examined, the 3rd significant component of a water supply system enters into play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its consumers. The biggest of these primary long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Normally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable covering, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes designed to bring bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. Most big cities need a number of aqueducts providing water from geographically apart and varied sources.</p>
