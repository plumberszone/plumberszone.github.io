<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits collect, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits take place more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a new one.</p>
