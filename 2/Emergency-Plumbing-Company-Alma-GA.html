<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
