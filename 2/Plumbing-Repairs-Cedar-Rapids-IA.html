<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in Cedar Rapids IA 52402</h3>
<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will collect in different parts of the plumbing system, most typically in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can trigger low flow concerns or even stop a fixture from flowing entirely. The next typical problem that occurs with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which takes place when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so extreme that it reduces the available volume of water that can stream around the system.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems typically are installed in large, unheated areas, such as parking lot. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is launched, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
