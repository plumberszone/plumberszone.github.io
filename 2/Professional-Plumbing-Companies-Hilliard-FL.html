<p>Dry pipe systems normally are installed in big, unheated locations, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
<p>In order to repipe your house, Cabrillo will need to get rid of small sections of your drywall so we can access and replace your pipes.

This is also the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired unit with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
