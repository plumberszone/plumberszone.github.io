<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint.

Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
