If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement may be essential.</p>

<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is kept and combined with water. If you prepare to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1).
