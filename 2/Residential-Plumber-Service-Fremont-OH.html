<p>Remember that an estimate check out does not obligate you to opt for that company. If the plumber that comes out offers you the heebie-jeebies or appears unreliable, call out the next company. You're searching for a company that you can place on speed dial for any plumbing problem, so it needs to be a company of people that you have a great, strong feeling about.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be restored, or, flushed clean.
