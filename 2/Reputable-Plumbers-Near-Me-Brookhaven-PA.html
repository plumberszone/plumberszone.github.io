<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing blockage service might seem like a waste of cash. Why invest in professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will work?

<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to prevent backflow. The basic means of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The standard system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
