<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits accumulate, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits happen more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>
