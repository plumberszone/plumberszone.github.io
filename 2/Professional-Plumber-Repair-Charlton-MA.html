<p>Most houses or structures that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather protection. As the outer coating of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
