<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back since he had another appointment. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you need to work with a plumber for that burner kit. The overall repair expense may remain in the $300 range.

That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Go for the brand-new heater.</p>
