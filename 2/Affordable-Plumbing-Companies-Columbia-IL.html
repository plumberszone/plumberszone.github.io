<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
