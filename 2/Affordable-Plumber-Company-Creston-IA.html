<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing procedure includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive material. Some softeners deal with electrical power, but some more recent water softeners use waterpower.

When the water is extremely hard and it is used heavily, the expenses of softening will rise.</p>
