<p>No other room in a home includes as numerous pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. When changing an under-sink assembly, look for quality products. Prevent flex pipe that can be bent into any setup, along with versatile rubber traps.

PVC assemblies are a great choice s they can be easily attached to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make certain it sets before testing the drain.</p>
<p>Then connect the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if appropriate).

While it's unlikely that having a disposal start up while your head is pressed versus it will lead to decapitation, it might frighten a number of years off your life. Not that I would understand from experience.</p>
