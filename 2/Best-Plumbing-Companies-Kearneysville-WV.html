<p>The economics of brand-new high-efficiency water softeners. The watering backflow testing season is from May to September. Watering backflow prevention assemblies should be evaluated by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to ensure proper backflow prevention remains in place to safeguard our drinking water throughout the irrigation season. Denver Water will send a testing suggestion notification thirty days before the annual test is due.</p>
<p>Installed under the sink, the waste disposal unit is suggested for chopping up smidgens of waste food.

When you tighten up the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
