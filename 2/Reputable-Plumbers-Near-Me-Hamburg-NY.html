<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
<p>Corrosion: The most typical problem is rust in the tank and pipes that link to your water heater. This is particularly true if you have neglected difficult water, which consists of severe minerals that can attach to the piping and tank and break down the material gradually. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another element that is causing the rust, you will eventually experience a leak in your hot water heater that is difficult to repair. Leaks frequently suggest a brand-new unit replacement is in order.</p>
