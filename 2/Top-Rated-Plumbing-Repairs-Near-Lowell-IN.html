Please note that Virginia's Building regulations restricts making use of any plumbing fixtures or devices prior to approval of all required inspections.

<p>These are all signs that your unit need to be inspected by a plumber. We do not advise attempting to repair this specific device by yourself, since it does present a safety threat, due to the sharp blades that are utilized to grind and slice waste. You must also avoid using any type of chemical drain cleaners on your waste disposal unit because these chemicals will just damage the device even more.</p>
<p>Polybutylene used inside your home can be found near the hot water heater or coming out of the walls to feed toilets or sinks. Warning: some plumbers set up stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Since copper is showing does not imply you do not have polybutylene pipes, simply. You may need to make a little hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
