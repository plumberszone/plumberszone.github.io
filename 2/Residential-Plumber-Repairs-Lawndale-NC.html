<p>As soon as you have actually found the trip lever you want, all you actually need to do is (CAREFULLY!) eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank.

Bear in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the correct method.
