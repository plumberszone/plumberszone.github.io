<p>Backflow is bad news. After an inspection has been set up utilizing the Permits and Inspections Online Permitting Service scheduling system, inspectors might be gotten in touch with between 8:00 am - 9:00 am the day of the inspection.

<p>Sewers, drains and waste piping are checked for proper grading to keep down flow. The plumbing system is checked for leakages. We inspect that the product used in the plumbing system is approved by an acknowledged testing lab. We prohibit cross connections between safe water and water from a doubtful source and prohibit the discharge of contaminated materials to the sewer system. We also inspect the vent pipes to stabilize the pressure in the plumbing system.</p>

<p>When you drop something down your drain or when you clean out a couple of hairs from the tub, it might seem like just a little annoyance. However, your drain system plays a much more substantial part in your plumbing system than you might recognize.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
