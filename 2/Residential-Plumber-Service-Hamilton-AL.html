Typically constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finishing, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines.
