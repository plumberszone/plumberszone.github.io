<p>A second part of the Battelle Research study compared cleaning agent dose, water hardness, and washing temperature level to see if firmness had an influence on cleaning agent cost savings. The research study included tests that eliminated challenging soils, in addition to assessing recording and spotting. Scientists found that softened water utilizes nearly 30% less detergent, however cleans along with water at 10 gpg solidity level.

Recurring leaks and repairs.

As a result, we advise replacing your system if it is over ten years old.</p>
