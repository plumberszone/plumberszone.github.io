Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back because he had another consultation.
