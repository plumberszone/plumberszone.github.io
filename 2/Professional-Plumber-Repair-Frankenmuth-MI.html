<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is stored and blended with water. If you plan to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not utilize your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate intact.</p>

Typically, it's set up near your cooking stop and waste. David Davia is the Executive Vice President & CEO of the Colorado Association of Mechanical and Plumbing Contractors. He called several of his member contractors to find out what a affordable and reasonable price would be for a garbage disposal install.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
