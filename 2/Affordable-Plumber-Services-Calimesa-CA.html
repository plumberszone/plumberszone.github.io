A hot water heater that is not set up correctly can lead to water damage, scalding temperatures, and even a fire. That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who know the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>DCVs are particularly developed to avoid backflow in fire sprinkler systems. The mainstay for regular fire defense applications, DCVs feature an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, two individually operating spring-loaded check valves (normally inside a single valve body), 4 test dicks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve. Light-duty commercial-grade waste disposal unit begin around $500-$ 2,500 and go up depending on size, brand and features.</p>
