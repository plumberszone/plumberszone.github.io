<p>Your sewer line is among the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes broken or clogged, it could wreak undesirable problems on your residential or commercial property. A house's service line (likewise called a sewer lateral) ranges from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. For the most part, the property owner is accountable for maintaining the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>You count on your drains to carry wastewater from your sink, tub or shower. With time, the drains become clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products gather in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them hard to eliminate. Your water heater is leaking: Water heater leakages are one of the most common signs that your system is at completion of its lifespan, particularly if they are causing significant flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
