<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts need to be eliminated and replaced with brand-new rubber parts. It is necessary that just original factory repair parts are used when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was created to utilize and altering the rubber from the initial factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
