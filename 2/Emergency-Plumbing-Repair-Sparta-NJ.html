<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Sparta NJ</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
