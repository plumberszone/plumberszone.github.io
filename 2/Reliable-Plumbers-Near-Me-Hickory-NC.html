Recurring repairs and leakages.

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be attached to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws initially meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can lead to improper drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
