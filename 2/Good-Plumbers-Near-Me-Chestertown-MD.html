Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not end up being useful to produce up until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. established an approach to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe started to be manufactured in the 1940s and was in large use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping throughout the restoration of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics producers in Western Europe and Japan started producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The technique for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was likewise established in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have ended up being increasingly typical, with a variety of products and fittings employed.</p>
