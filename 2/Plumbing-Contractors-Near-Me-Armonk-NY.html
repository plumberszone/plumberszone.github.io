<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals state, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular occurrence, but it does occur more often than you think! Typically it happens in the evening when you do not notice the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction projects quickly the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks use substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding communities.</p>

Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for lots of decades, but steel ultimately struggles with deterioration and lacks the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
