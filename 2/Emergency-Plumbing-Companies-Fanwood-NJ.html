<p>Your disposer might come with a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, instead of the conventional plumber's putty as laid out below. Both will develop a great seal (though the gasket may result in small amounts of water collecting around the flange), and what's used is mostly a matter of preference. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to get rid of.</p>
<p>Gas line leaks are a severe safety concern. Don't take any chances. Make certain the softener is set to the solidity of your water system.

<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This triggers the disc to open, enabling air to enter the valve and bring back pressure equivalent to ambient climatic requirement. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
