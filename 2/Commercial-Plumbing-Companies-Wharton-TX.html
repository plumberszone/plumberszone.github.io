This device includes no less than 5 individually operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. During standard water streams at style pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline.

Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, typically regenerate after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are convenient if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
