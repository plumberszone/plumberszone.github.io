<p>You see rust in your water: If you start to observe rust in your water, it might be an indication that you need pipe repair or drain repair services. When pipes have ended up being corroded, Rust typically seeps into the water supply. Although rust isn't inherently unsafe for your health, it can be a sign of problem to come. If you buy a replacement that's made by the same producer as your old design, you may have the ability to bypass the need to replace the waste assembly and installing flange in the sink, significantly streamlining the task (it can be a bigger, more powerful unit-- it just requires to have the very same mounting flange).</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material.

More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet this boost can present problems.</p>

The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is complete.
