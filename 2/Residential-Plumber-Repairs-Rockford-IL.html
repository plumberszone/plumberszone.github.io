<p>Leaks are sneaky. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften difficult water.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
