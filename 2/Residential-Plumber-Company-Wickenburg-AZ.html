<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
