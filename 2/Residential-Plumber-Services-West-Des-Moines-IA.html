<h3>Why Plumbers Are So Expensive West Des Moines IA</h3>
<p>Rusty water: If you have rusty water coming out of your faucets, particularly if that water is hot, the inside of your unit is most likely rusty. If it only occurs with warm water, you will likely need to replace your hot water heater. You probably don't know what type of pipes you have if you're like many house owners. A plumber from 1st Option Plumbing can tell you for sure, however in basic, there are three main types of pipes that tend to have problems.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have moderately tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
