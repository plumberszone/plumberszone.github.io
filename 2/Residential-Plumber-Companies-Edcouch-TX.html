<h3>Water Heater Repair Procedures at Edcouch TX 78538</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months back. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending on the marketplace and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>Pointer: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not avoid back-pressure. I recently had a number of plumbing leaks fixed and couldn't be happier with the prompt service I received from Parker and Sons. They are extremely experienced, friendly, fairly priced, and do quality work. I would definitely advise them to my household and everybody. I would trust them to repair any leak in your home.</p>
