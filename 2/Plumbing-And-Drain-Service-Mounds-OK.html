<p>Due to the fact that we train them ourselves in our own in-house training center, our technicians are drain and sewer experts.

<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in many cases it ought to be much less water.</p>

<p>You can use a wire coat wall mount by correcting it if you don't have a plumber's snake. Obviously, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some blockages. Insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or take out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
