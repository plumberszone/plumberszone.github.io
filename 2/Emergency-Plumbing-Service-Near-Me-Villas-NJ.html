It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is kept and blended with water. If you prepare to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not use your unit to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate undamaged.</p>
