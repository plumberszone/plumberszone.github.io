<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is since the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in most cases it should be much less water.</p>

Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flow chart is needed to ensure it was repaired effectively.
