This can trigger low circulation issues and even stop a component from flowing entirely. The next common problem that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which happens when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so serious that it decreases the readily available volume of water that can stream around the system.</p>
