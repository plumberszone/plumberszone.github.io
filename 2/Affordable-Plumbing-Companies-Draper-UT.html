<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>

When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the infected water to end up being a health hazard if permitted to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for efficiency, in addition to inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
