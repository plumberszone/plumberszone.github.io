<p>Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on extremely gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close correctly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
<p>Check the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and switch on the disposal to make sure it works. Inspect below to be sure there aren't any leaks. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of properly. Pipes made from galvanized steel are no longer utilized in new houses, however lots of houses constructed in between the 1930s - 1980s still have them. Galvanized steel pipes need to be removed by a professional plumber when discovered and changed with another pipe material.</p>
