<p>It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an appropriately operating RPZ assembly to periodically discharge small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in locations subject to water damage. Sufficient drainage must likewise be offered.</p>
