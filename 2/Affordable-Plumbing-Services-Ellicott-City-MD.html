<h3>How to Fix a Leaky Faucet from the Kitchen in Ellicott City MD 21043</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March said depending on the marketplace and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
