<p>Passive Purge - Approximately 2007, some homes were allowed to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of one or more toilets in the house. Usually, the supply of water to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire lawn sprinkler; upon each usage, fresh water was introduced into the fire lawn sprinkler.</p>
<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts need to be removed and replaced with brand-new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is important that only original factory repair parts are used. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to utilize and altering the rubber from the original factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
