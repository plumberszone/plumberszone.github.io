This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is merely capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (normally sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
