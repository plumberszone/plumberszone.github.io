<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have very tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a really important part of the design of each element. If the component is not repaired correctly, the guide might limit the movement (rather than stable or direct) of the component, which might trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
