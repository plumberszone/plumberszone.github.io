This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term solidity" originated from ... it's hard to wash in.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continually bringing tanks on-line and off-line in action to the water needs of your carwash.

This responsive design allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
