<p>Finally, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. During basic water flows at style pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close.
