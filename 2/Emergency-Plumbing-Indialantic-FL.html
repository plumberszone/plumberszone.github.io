<p>The concern of leak can be credited to any number of elements which can range from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, along with bad maintenance. The water heater tank must have some room to represent the growth that occurs when heating the water. The thermal growth needs to escape, hence the need for a growth tank to help manage the pressure. The force exerted by the growth taking place when boiling the water causes the reservoir to split and start leaking if the tank is old and used out.
