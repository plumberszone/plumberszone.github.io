<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
