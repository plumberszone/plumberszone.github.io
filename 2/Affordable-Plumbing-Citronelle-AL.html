<p>Leakages are tricky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capability to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>

Cations refer to positively charged ions liquified in the water. Cation exchange involves the replacement of the hardness ions with a nonhardness ion. Master plumbers shall not charge for their services grossly extreme rates, or otherwise take excessive advantage of an unwary public.</p>
