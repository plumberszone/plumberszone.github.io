<p>Backflow preventers are crucial for creating a safe water supply system. Since they're less vulnerable to rust, stainless steel blades are generally preferred.

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
