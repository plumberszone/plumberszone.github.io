<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless for the most part it ought to be much less water.</p>

The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>In order to insure the proper operation of a backflow prevention assembly, it must be checked and certified upon installation and a minimum of once a year afterwards if installed to protect form a health risk circumstance.

Therefore, all backflow prevention assemblies need to be evaluated occasionally to ensure that they are working effectively. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have to be tested with correctly adjusted gauge devices.</p>
