<p>It is very important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an appropriately functioning RPZ assembly to occasionally release percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in areas based on water damage. Adequate drainage needs to likewise be offered.</p>
<p>Changing your flapper might require slightly different actions than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task if you have an unusual flush valve. To find an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Switch off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, however opportunities are you'll find one of the exact same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
