Generally, minerals get there due to the fact that groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants travel with the water till it is in your house. Water softening utilizes an ion exchange procedure to get rid of dissolved minerals that aren't as effectively gotten rid of by mechanical filtration. These products are what causes tough water.</p>
