<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it does not grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck. Attempt releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat hanger by aligning it. Naturally, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some obstructions. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
