<p>Difficult water usage may impact the performance of household devices. When heated, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the warm water heater. A big scale accumulation slows the heating process and needs more energy to heat water. Water heaters with big build-ups of mineral buildup will have a shorter life span. Scale deposits also build up to plug plumbing fixtures and develop in other home appliances such as coffee pots and dishwashing machines, hence impacting their efficiency.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you have actually been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
