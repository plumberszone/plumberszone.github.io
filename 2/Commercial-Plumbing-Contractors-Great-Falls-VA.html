<h3>Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Great Falls VA 22066</h3>
<p>While this might appear like a problem with your faucet, it's typically brought on by something else - like a plumbing concern or problem with your water heater.

When it's time for replacement, here's how to assess your plumbing system and understand.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
