<p>Is your drain clogged with debris, hair, or toilet paper? After years of use, drains can collect harmful accumulation. This accumulation obstructs water circulation, ultimately supporting your drains until they are unusable. Generally, all the pipes need is a great scrubbing. We can achieve this through a variety of approaches such as snaking the drain, mini-jetting, grease trap cleaning, or hydro jetting.</p>
<p>Unless you have a clever two-year old who loves to throw toilet paper down the toilet, you should not have frequent obstructing issues. In reality, you should seldom have a clogged toilet if you are using it appropriately and if it is working appropriately. If you are having a toilet that clogs constantly and in need of toilet repair from Vegas Valley Plumbing regularly, then it's most likely time for a brand-new toilet. This might be a sign that your toilet has a malfunctioning part or there is a different blockage in your sewer lines. In either case, you need to call us for a house plumbing inspection promptly.</p>
