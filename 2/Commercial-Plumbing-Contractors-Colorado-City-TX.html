<p>It's Making sounds - As your water warms, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom. This will cause it to work harder and can create noise. If your energy costs are increasing, a new, higher efficiency hot water heater can bring them back down. All that has to be done is closing off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open the bypass valve, allowing difficult water to flow to the tank and household taps. After that the softener can be detached, relocated to its new place and put there.</p>
<p>Longstanding Clogs: Obstructions that continue after you have actually attempted to repair them require professional assistance. Continued attempts on your own can hurt your lines, and you may have a more severe underlying issue than you know. Additionally, the longer you postpone to require professional assistance, the higher the probability that you will have sewage back up in your pipes.</p>
