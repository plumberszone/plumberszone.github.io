<p>Depending on the size of your home, repiping may take anywhere from a couple of days to a week. Normally, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that needs complete water shut down while you are out and about during the day, so you experience minimal disruption to your everyday regimen. To begin the repiping process, the plumbing group will first cover any carpet and furniture to protect them from dust and debris. They will then make little cuts in the wall and drywall to locate the pipes and after that eliminate and replace them, leaving as much of the initial building material as possible undamaged.</p>
