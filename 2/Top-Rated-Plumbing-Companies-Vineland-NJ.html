<p>When you encounter a plumbing problem it might be a minor leak or a more significant situation. If you have a problem with the sewer line it is a very major issue that requires instant attention.  The sewer line is the pipe that links your home to the outdoors sewer system. It is responsible for managing all of the waste water from your home from your toilets, sinks and other appliances. If the sewer pipe becomes broken or bursts, it can cause an important problem in your house. You'll need to call a plumber for sewer line repair in Lawrenceville.</p>
<p>Pictures supplied by the American Backflow Prevention Association. The cost to repipe a house with copper pipe is between $8,000 and $16,000 or about $3 to $8 per linear foot.
