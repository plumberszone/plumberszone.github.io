<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your lawn. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images caught by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can quickly cause thousands of dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel method off schedule. So hiring a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers handle all kinds of work. Their tasks break out into 2 classifications: Plumbers who handle basic repairs (frequently in emergency circumstances), and plumbers who focus on redesigning tasks and additions.</p>
