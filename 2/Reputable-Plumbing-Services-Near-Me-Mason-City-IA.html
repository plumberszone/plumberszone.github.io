<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your lawn. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images caught by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
