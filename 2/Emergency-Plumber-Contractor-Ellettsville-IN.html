<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>

<h3>Things To Know Before Hiring A Sewer Cleaning Company in Ellettsville IN 47429</h3>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity.
