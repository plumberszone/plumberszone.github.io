That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer determines the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of 4, regrowth usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>

When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the solution by the salt ions.</p>
