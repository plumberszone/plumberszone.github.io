Well-kept pipes might last longer, and inadequately kept ones or those in areas with difficult water (suggesting it has high mineral material), might fail quicker, says Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who provided the life-span estimates.</p>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to hire a plumber for that burner package. The total repair expense may remain in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800).
