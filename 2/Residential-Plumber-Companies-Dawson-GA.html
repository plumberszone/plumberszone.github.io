<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals say, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a regular event, but it does occur regularly than you think! Frequently it happens in the evening when you don't see the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or link a new pipe. This makes building tasks easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks use substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding communities.</p>
