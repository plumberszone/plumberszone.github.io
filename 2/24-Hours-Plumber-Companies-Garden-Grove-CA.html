When you experience obstructions in several drains at once in your home, then that normally suggests that your main sewer line is supporting. This can occur in several areas and any combination of drains. For example, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous mixes of this type of backup.

<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are mainly time related. If everything is ready, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be modified, replaced, or transferred to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours required and therefore the overall costs. A lot of plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with a lot of disposal setups running $50 per hour for three hours overall, making the labor costs roughly $150.</p>
