<h3>Water Heater Repair Procedures in Hawthorne NJ 07506</h3>
<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is merely catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (generally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
