<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a practical option, especially when easy plunging does not appear to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they typically include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, however at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your house and family.</p>
