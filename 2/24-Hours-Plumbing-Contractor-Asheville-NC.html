<p>Video cameras are one of the most important tools in the plumbing organisation. Determine the size of the pipes in the home and around the house - they will assist to determine the water pressure that you'll have.

<p>Wire the disposal. Some disposals come with device wires connected, and others do not. Get rid of the cover plate below the disposal and attach the wires according the maker's guidelines if yours doesn't. Many basic disposals have you attach white wires to white wires and black wires to black wires. When you're completed, screw the cover plate back on.</p>
