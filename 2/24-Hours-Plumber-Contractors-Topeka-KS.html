<h3>Water Heater Repair Services in Topeka KS 66614</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months back. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending on the market and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
