<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Sturgeon Bay WI</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
