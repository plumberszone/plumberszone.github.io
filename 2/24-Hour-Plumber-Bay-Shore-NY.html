<h3>When To Call A Plumber Bay Shore NY</h3>
<p>Most homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to wear away.

Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather condition protection. As the outer covering of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>

The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
