<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.
