<p>When choosing an insured and licensed plumbing contractor is simply a basic phone call away, why risk an insurance claim on a flooded house. A malfunctioning toilet is one household issue most of us would rather prevent. However, you can not overlook a toilet concern. Leaks can trigger your water costs to increase, and some obstructions and leakages can develop unsanitary conditions.

<p>Then attach the drain (and dishwasher hose, if appropriate). If your system is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- ensure your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the brand-new unit in.

When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
