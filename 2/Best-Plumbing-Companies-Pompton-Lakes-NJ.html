<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Pompton Lakes NJ</h3>
<p>We're changing a gas water heater in our presentation. The steps for replacing a gas water heater are exactly the same, and those for an electric water heater are comparable. Recurring repairs and leaks. If your hot water heater is over ten years old, it has actually likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not affordable in the long run. As a result, we recommend changing your unit if it is over 10 years old.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is a sign the tank is failing and will need to be replaced. If it is in a garage and a little slow leak, schedule a price quote as quickly as possible and ensure nothing is near the heater that might be potentially harmed. Leaking hot water heater can burst triggering water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
