And make sure a plumbing or electrical inspector checks your work.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>

<p>It's an oddly complicated scientific process, however easy to remedy. It uses salt to get rid of odors and minerals discovered in tough water- most commonly calcium and magnesium.
