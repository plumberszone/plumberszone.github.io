<p>The problem of leak can be attributed to any variety of elements which can range from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, along with poor maintenance. The hot water heater tank should have some room to account for the expansion that happens when heating the water. The thermal growth needs to leave, thus the need for a growth tank to help control the pressure. If the tank is old and worn, the force applied by the expansion occurring when boiling the water triggers the tank to break and begin leaking.
