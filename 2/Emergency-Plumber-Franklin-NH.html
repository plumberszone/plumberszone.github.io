<h3>Affordable Plumbing Services Franklin NH</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
