<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a range of materials were utilized for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are resilient in the short-term, they deteriorate over decades.

After about fifty years, they'll begin to deteriorate from corrosion and might put contaminants into the freshwater supply. We advise changing the clay, iron, and steel pipes in your home.

That repair bill is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Opt for the brand-new heater.</p>
