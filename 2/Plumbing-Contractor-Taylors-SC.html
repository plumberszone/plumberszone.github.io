For instance, if your water piping is galvanized pipe and pressure is a concern, you may need all of your water piping changed. Again, very pricey. This is simply among lots of concerns that can surface.</p>
<p>Then connect the drain (and dishwasher hose, if relevant). If your system is outlet-ready-- pay attention to this part-- make sure your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the new unit in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal start up while your head is pushed against it will result in decapitation, it might frighten a number of years off your life. Not that I would understand from experience.</p>
