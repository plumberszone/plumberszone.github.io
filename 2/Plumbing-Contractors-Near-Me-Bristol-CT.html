Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
