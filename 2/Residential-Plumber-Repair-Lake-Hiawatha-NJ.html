He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another consultation, they called him back and he stated he would not come back.
