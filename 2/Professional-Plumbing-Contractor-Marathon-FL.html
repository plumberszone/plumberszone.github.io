<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
