<p>Prior to installing, your professional will switch off water and electricity to the area. Next, the old sink flange is eliminated and cleaned of any putty residue. Then, a brand-new mounting ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is linked, and the disposal is connected to its mount.
