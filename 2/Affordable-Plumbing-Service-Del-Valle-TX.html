<p>City of Bellingham checks backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be evaluated by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report must be offered to the City of Bellingham.

When you include a water softener, it eliminates the mineral content to produce odor free drinking water that tastes excellent.</p>
