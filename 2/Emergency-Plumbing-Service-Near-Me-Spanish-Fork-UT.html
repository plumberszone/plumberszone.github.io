Usually built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finish, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes created to carry bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. A lot of large cities need numerous aqueducts supplying water from geographically separated and diverse sources.</p>
