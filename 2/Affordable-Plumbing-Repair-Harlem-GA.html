<p>Your disposer may come with a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, rather of the traditional plumber's putty as described listed below. Both will develop a great seal (though the gasket may result in small amounts of water gathering around the flange), and what's utilized is largely a matter of choice. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's harder to get rid of.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply.
