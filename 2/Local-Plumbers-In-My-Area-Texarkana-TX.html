<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An important thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each part. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide could limit the movement (rather than stable or direct) of the component, which might trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
