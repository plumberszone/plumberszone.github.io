<p>The majority of houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather defense. As the outer finishing of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws originally meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can cause inappropriate drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
