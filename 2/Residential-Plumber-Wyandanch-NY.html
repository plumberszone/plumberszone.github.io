<p>Plastic pipe remains in broad use for domestic supply of water and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not become useful to produce until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. established a method to plasticize PVC, making it simpler to process. PVC pipe began to be produced in the 1940s and was in large usage for Drain-Waste-Vent piping throughout the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics manufacturers in Western Europe and Japan started producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe.

Plastic supply pipes have become increasingly typical, with a variety of fittings and products employed.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and eliminate water molecules from the solution with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is free of hardness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
