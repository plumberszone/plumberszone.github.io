<p>Disadvantages to be familiar with is that hybrid hot water heater need to be installed in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids require as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to capture sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material covered with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
