<p>Two styles of PVBs are readily available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of a separately acting, spring-loaded check valve and an independently acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test cocks. A PVB may be used to isolate health or non-health hazards but is effective versus back-siphonage only.</p>
<p>DCVs are particularly created to avoid backflow in fire sprinkler systems. The essential for typical fire defense applications, DCVs feature an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, two individually running spring-loaded check valves (usually inside a single valve body), 4 test cocks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve. Light-duty commercial-grade garbage disposals begin around $500-$ 2,500 and go up depending upon size, brand name and features.</p>
<p>Our skilled technicians have many systems and tricks of the trade that can really reduce the effect on the house and avoid much of the wall and tile repair. From threading pipes through existing holes to specifically developed cover plates for shower valves, it may not be as invasive as you may think. That being stated, there are, obviously, lot of times when we will be opening a wall to gain access to piping. The good news is that we can consist of wall repair in our scope so that you are not left looking for multiple contractors to get the task finished.</p>
<p>Pro Tip: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the unit, now is the best time to remove the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Utilize a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet till the plug is broken off; recover the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
