<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
