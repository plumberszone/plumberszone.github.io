<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a viable solution, especially when easy plunging doesn't appear to work.

These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
