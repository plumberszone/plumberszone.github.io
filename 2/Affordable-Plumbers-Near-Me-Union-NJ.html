<p>Most homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to wear away.

As the outer finish of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
