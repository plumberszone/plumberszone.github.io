<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
