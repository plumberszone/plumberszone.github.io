<p>Leaks are sly. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt because they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, normally restore after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have an ever-changing water utilize schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
