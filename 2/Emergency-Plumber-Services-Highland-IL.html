<p>Last but not least, the most sophisticated and complicated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 individually operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water streams at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if pricey) device is best used in important locations where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>

<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is just catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (typically salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
