<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
