Rust can literally eat a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or change the tolerances causing parts to not operate in a backflow preventer.

Backflow preventers have springs, rubber seals and other moving parts that wear out over time and it's important that they receivethe same regular maintenance that your automobile or HEATING AND COOLING system gets to ensure your family's water is safe & clean.</p>
