<h3>Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Plumbers Bellaire TX</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
