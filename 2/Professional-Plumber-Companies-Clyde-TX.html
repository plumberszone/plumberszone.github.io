<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure.

<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your house. When you experience obstructions in several drains simultaneously in your home, then that usually indicates that your main sewer line is backing up. This can occur in numerous areas and any mix of drains. For example, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous mixes of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your house.</p>
<p>Repipers start by covering floors and furnishings to safeguard them from water damage and dust throughout the work. They then find the pipes in your walls with small cuts into the drywall of the walls and ceilings.

To access pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, enter through the ceiling listed below it. You can arrange to have additional pipes put in at this time if you need to expand your water service for a remodel if you wish.</p>
