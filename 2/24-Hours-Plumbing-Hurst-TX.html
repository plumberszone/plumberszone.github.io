<p>In the 1990 â€² s, drought conditions determined water providers to execute water preservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet components in homes were changed with 1.6 - gallons per flush designs. Continuous obstructions: If the plunger has actually ended up being a routine component in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement.
