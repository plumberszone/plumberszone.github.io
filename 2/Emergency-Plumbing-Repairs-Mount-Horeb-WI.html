<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and costly plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping.

<p>A 2nd part of the Battelle Research study compared detergent dosage, water firmness, and washing temperature to see if firmness had an impact on cleaning agent cost savings. The research study included tests that removed challenging soils, in addition to examining spotting and shooting. Researchers discovered that softened water utilizes almost 30% less cleaning agent, but cleans as well as water at 10 gpg firmness level. That detergent cost savings increases to nearly 70% when comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level.</p>
