<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not really the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>

<p>Tough water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are changed in the service by the salt ions.</p>
