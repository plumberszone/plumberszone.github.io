<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
<p>Here's what to expect on the day of your water heater installation visit. Setting up natural gas lines can bring a brand-new level of service. As difficult water travels through the mineral tank, the beads inside draw in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that trigger hard water adhere to the beads, and the treated water heads out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
