<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
