<h3>Water Leak Repair in Midland Michigan</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water innovation start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, revealed today they have attained a breakthrough in water softening treatment utilizing an exclusive Surface Accelerated Crystallization (SACr) technology. SACr physically gets rid of short-term solidity without using chemicals or high pressure, which are major restrictions of existing softening technologies.</p>
<p>Some pipe materials are less expensive than others; some are more vulnerable and fragile to breaking, displacement or other kinds of structural failure. Other materials are prone to corrosion and rust while some are untouched. Specific pipe products have greater coefficients of heat strain, making them more susceptible to structural stresses and stress as a result of temperature change and ice formation. And these distinctions dictate the potential need for backflow preventers.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
