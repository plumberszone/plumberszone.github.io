<h3>Shower Repairs in Bloomington IL 61701 - The Processes Involved</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the clog with unfavorable pressure, it in fact pushes into the clog, working further into where the obstruction is happening. The auger or snake" is then utilized to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip helps require it even more down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
<p>In addition to clogged drain repair, you can rely on Waldrop for leaking drain repair. With time, the material your drain is made from can begin to wear away, break down, and eventually crack with typical use, leading to a leak.
