During hours of low demand, the water circulation can be used to fill up storage towers, tanks and tanks, which then provide water for emergency use and periods when demand goes beyond the standard pumping rate. A supply of water source can take numerous kinds, consisting of groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, man-made or natural ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
