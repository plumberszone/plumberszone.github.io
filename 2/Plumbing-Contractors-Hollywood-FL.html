<p>Have utilized Plumb Crazy on 3 various events, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our professionals and they were wonderful. They quickly discovered the leak and fixed it without making a huge mess. They, similar to everyone we have actually encountered with Plumb Crazy, were considerate, prompt, and really well-informed. I would suggest Plumb Crazy to anyone needing either big or small task plumbing work.</p>
<p>Testing should be completed by a contractor signed up with the Cross Connection Control office. The contractor needs to possess a legitimate, current plumbing license, present insurance, backflow preventer testing certification, and currently adjusted test package. For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is needed.</p>
