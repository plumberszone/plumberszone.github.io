This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition defense. As the outer finishing of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
