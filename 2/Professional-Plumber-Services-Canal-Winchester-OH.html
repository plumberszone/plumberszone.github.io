<p>You count on your drains to bring wastewater from your shower, tub or sink. With time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products gather in the drain and eventually harden versus the pipe walls, making them hard to remove.

<p>The pipes in your home are accountable for supplying you with water for a number of your day-to-day activities. They rarely get much time to rest in between use, so it must come as not a surprise that gradually, they begin to use and experience problems. Though this is perfectly normal, it does not make it any less bothersome. Provide the team at Big Blue Plumbing a call when you discover yourself in need of repiping in Oakland or Alameda.</p>
<p>Examining the water meter is an excellent next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and check if the water meter is turning. If it is, there is a leak somewhere and this could be major issue. Move on to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation. When turned off, no faucet in the house should have water. This goes for every other turned off valve and their corresponding faucets. If everything is working effectively, you are off to an excellent start.</p>
<p>The easiest option may appear to be just ignoring the issue or utilizing a do it yourself chemical solution. Nevertheless, this is a momentary fix and may trigger more damage. Some pipe products, like copper or cast-iron, are sensitive to chemicals. Chemical cleaners can rust and erode your pipes, triggering significant leakages, cracks, and big damages.</p>
