<p>The typical solution is to have the faulty pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to think about if you reside in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many decades, however steel ultimately struggles with rust and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
