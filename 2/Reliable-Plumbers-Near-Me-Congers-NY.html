<h3>Benefits Of Commercial Plumbing Services Congers NY</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Observing high water pressure at plumbing components in your house? Water pressure in the home resembles high blood pressure in the body - it needs to be managed to keep the system healthy. When unregulated water pressure causes damage to the plumbing system, this can lead to emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator installed is MUCH more cost-efficient than mold removal or replacing flooring or drywall! So we suggest setting up or repairing water pressure regulators to secure your entire home.</p>
