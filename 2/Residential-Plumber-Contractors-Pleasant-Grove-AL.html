<h3>Need An Emergency Plumber Pleasant Grove AL</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>If you have a big bathtub or more that 2 bathrooms, this design hot water heater might make the most sense for you. There are some installation factors to consider, especially around sizing the gas line and setting up the flue vent, however with the ability for a 50-gallon tank to create more warm water than a standard 80-gallon tank, these things are quite unique. High-efficiency storage is a great option for area heating hydronic choices too.</p>
