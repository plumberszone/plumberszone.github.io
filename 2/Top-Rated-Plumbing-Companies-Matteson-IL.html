<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of corrosion A softener is merely capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (generally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
<p>Stegle states that when they are working with a customer on a custom-made home, they will work directly with the property owner when it concerns picking faucets and other components.
