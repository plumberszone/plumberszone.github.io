<p>Metal alloys are vulnerable to an electro-chemical condition called corrosion. Rust can literally consume a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or modify the tolerances triggering parts to not work in a backflow preventer. The effect of rust on a metal alloy need to be examined to figure out if the part is usable or need to be replaced.</p>
<p>The correct repair of a backflow preventer requires many items to be examined. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly should be assessed. The installation must be examined to guarantee it does not prevent the functions of the assembly. Test data need to be collected to identify the operations of each component. The backflow prevention assembly should be taken apart and parts changed with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be checked once again to be sure it was appropriately fixed. Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flow diagram is essential to ensure it was repaired properly. An effectively fixed assembly must provide years of protection.</p>
