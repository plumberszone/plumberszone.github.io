<h3>Fast Emergency Plumbers Near Me Egg Harbor City NJ</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede against the required direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being polluted. There is potential for the infected water to become a health risk if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for effectiveness, along with inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
