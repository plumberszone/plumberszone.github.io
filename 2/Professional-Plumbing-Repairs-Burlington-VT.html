<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Burlington VT 05401</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months back. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the market and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>There are various brands of sink for the utility, kitchen, and bath room, and you can choose from sink products like porcelain or ceramic, enameled stainless-steel, plain stainless-steel, and even plastic. Thankfully, all sinks work pretty much the same method, and follow the exact same basic design. Candu Pros can service sinks from all the major brands. If you're changing sink hardware like faucets or drains, your Candu Pro can assist with that, too.</p>
<p>Passive Purge - Up to 2007, some homes were allowed to bypass a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of one or more toilets in the home. Usually, the water system to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each use, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
