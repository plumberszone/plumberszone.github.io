<p>You can utilize a wire coat wall mount by straightening it if you do not have a plumber's snake. Naturally, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some blockages. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or take out the clog if you can reach it. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
