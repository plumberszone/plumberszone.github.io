<p>Recurring blockages or clogs that are extremely tough to clear could show a more significant issue than an easy clog.

A video inspection is most often needed to discover the source of the recurring issue.</p>
<p>Some pipe products are less expensive than others; some are more breakable and vulnerable to breaking, displacement or other types of structural failure. Other materials are susceptible to deterioration and rust while some are unaffected. Particular pipe materials have greater coefficients of heat stress, making them more vulnerable to structural tensions and pressures as an outcome of temperature level change and ice formation. And these differences dictate the potential need for backflow preventers.</p>
