<p>As a locally-owned company, integrity and obligation are exceptionally crucial to building a track record for excellence. Note: The disposer outlet need to be above the drain line coming out of the wall. If it isn't, you'll need to either pick a smaller sized disposer, or customize the plumbing to accommodate the new setup. Foul smells. A functional sewer line should always be sealed airtight, indicating no water or gas need to ever leak out. If however, you start smelling something nasty coming out of your drains or around your home, there could be a fracture someplace in your sewer line.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
