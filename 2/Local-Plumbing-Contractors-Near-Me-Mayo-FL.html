<p>Inspect the washer for wear or fractures when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is low-cost and simple. But finding the best washer might not be. The most common washers are frequently offered in your home centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be difficult to discover. Remove it and take it to the store to find a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers normally replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>From below the sink, put a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make certain the drain compression seal is seated properly in the drain locknut, then reinstall and tighten the drain locknut. Lastly, switch on the water and test for leakages.</p>
<p>Additionally, there might be a fracture in the porcelain, either the toilet or the tank bowl itself.
