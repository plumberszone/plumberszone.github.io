The direct exposure to carbon monoxide gas is so fatal that anybody who inhales it requires instant medical attention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that 5149 people died from carbon monoxide poisoning in between 1999 and 2010. To avoid this disaster, make certain to use your gas ranges exactly as instructed and never to utilize them to warm your home. The same goes for portable gas stoves, which are to be used outdoors only and not indoors. When running the space-heaters, make certain someone is awake to monitor them.
