<p>106.2.2.1 Other than Group R-3 Occupancies. The intent of the 10-percent rule exemptions in Section 106.2.2 will apply to minor repairs and replacement piping only.

Comparing the test arises from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flow diagram is essential to guarantee it was fixed correctly. An appropriately repaired assembly needs to provide years of defense.</p>
