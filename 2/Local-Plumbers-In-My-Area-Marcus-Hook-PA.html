<p>Tankless electric hot water heater can be found in 2 types. There are whole-house heaters that are large and powerful enough to supply warm water to all restrooms, cooking areas, and home appliances in a house. On the other hand, there are the point-of-use electrical heaters that supply warm water to specific spaces or devices only. Both whole-house and point-of-use heaters work the same method.
