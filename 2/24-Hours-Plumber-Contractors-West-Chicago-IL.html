<p>Find the right water softener for you. One common way for a home's water supply to be polluted is if the watering water lines, which could end up being polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines.

<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
