<p>All you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) as soon as you have actually discovered the journey lever you want eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Remember that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the right way. When you have actually protected the journey lever and are prepared to connect your flapper, ensure you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
