The policy was not strictly imposed until a push in recent years by the DEP's Cross-Connection Control Program, an effort that consists of regular random inspections of New York City structures to make sure they remain in compliance.</p>
<p>DCVs are specifically designed to avoid backflow in fire sprinkler systems. The essential for regular fire security applications, DCVs include an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, two independently operating spring-loaded check valves (usually inside a single valve body), 4 test dicks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve.
