<p>Minerals in water are what makes sure water considered hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most common minerals discovered in water. Typically, minerals arrive due to the fact that groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants travel with the water until it is in your house. Water softening uses an ion exchange process to remove dissolved minerals that aren't as successfully gotten rid of by mechanical filtration. These products are what triggers tough water.</p>
<p>Discovering high water pressure at plumbing fixtures in your home? Water pressure in the home is similar to blood pressure in the body - it needs to be managed to keep the system healthy. When unregulated water pressure triggers damage to the plumbing system, this can result in emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator installed is MUCH more cost-effective than mold remediation or replacing flooring or drywall! So we suggest repairing or installing water pressure regulators to safeguard your entire home.</p>
