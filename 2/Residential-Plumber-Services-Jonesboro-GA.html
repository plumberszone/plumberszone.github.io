<p>Prior to choice and installation, describe makers literature for temperature varieties. All assemblies must be secured from freezing temperature levels and if set up where temperatures will reach 100 degrees F or above, a warm water type assembly should be used.

When heating the water, the water heater tank need to have some room to account for the growth that takes location. The thermal growth requires to escape, for this reason the need for an expansion tank to help control the pressure. The force put in by the expansion taking place when boiling the water causes the reservoir to break and begin leaking if the tank is old and worn out.
