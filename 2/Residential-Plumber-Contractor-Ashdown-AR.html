<p>A malfunctioning waste disposal unit, grease buildup, accumulated food and more can all add to a clogged kitchen sink. The sink is the centerpiece in the kitchen and when you have a clogged kitchen sink, that will trigger problems. There are a variety of methods property owners can unclog a kitchen sink, including utilizing a sink plunger, snaking the drain, or using a solution of vinegar and baking soda. For the more extreme clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Roto-Rooter plumber.</p>
