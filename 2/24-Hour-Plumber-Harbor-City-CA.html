<p>Discussing whether to repair or replace your water heater? Our specialists will offer you an honest recommendation. In general, older hot water heater (over 8-10 years) experiencing recurring problems are better off being changed. A newer, more effective hot water heater will save you in repair expenses and energy over time. Old-fashioned water softeners are notorious for causing a spike in the rate of your monthly energy costs. Many require large quantities of water and can be costly for the electrical power expense, but the NuvoH2O system is various.
