<p>Discussing whether to repair or replace your water heater? Our specialists will offer you an honest recommendation. In general, older hot water heater (over 8-10 years) experiencing recurring problems are better off being changed. A newer, more effective hot water heater will save you in repair expenses and energy over time. Old-fashioned water softeners are notorious for causing a spike in the rate of your monthly energy costs. Many require large quantities of water and can be costly for the electrical power expense, but the NuvoH2O system is various. Our saltless WATER conditioning system consumes to 4x less water than others and requires no electricity.</p>
