<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
