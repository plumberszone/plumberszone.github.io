<p>Spotty dishes? Some underground gutter drains terminate in the sewer system rather of at the edge of your lawn.

<p>Responsive circulation innovation works by constantly bringing tanks on-line and off-line in reaction to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, just one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize when backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
