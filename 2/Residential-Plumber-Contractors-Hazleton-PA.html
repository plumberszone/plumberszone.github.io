<h3>How To Install A Sand Trap Drain Hazleton PA</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Discovering the location or source of a problem is done through visual inspection of sewer pipes, color testing, and closed circuit video of the sewer main.
