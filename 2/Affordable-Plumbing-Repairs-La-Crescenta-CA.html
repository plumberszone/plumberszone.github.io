<p>Prior to setting up, your professional will switch off water and electrical energy to the area. Next, the old sink flange is eliminated and cleaned of any putty residue. Then, a new installing ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is attached to its install. In this method, water is treated with a calculated quantity of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get precipitated.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
