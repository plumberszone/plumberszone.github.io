<p>Backflow is bad news. After an inspection has actually been arranged using the Permits and Inspections Online Permitting Service scheduling system, inspectors might be called between 8:00 am - 9:00 am the day of the inspection.

<p>A backflow preventer is a way or mechanism to avoid backflow. The fundamental means of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either eliminates a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The basic mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly.</p>
