Usually, minerals get there because groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants take a trip with the water up until it is in your home. Water softening uses an ion exchange process to remove liquified minerals that aren't as efficiently gotten rid of by mechanical filtration. These materials are what triggers difficult water.</p>
