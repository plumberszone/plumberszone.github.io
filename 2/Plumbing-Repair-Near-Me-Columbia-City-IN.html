<p>Most property owners have conventional water heaters that include a tank where warm water is kept. While these are affordable initially buy, they are not the most effective or reliable way for you to receive hot water, specifically if your system is dated.

<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
