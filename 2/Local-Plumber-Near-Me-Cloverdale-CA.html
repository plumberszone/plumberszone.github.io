<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners remove calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Put simply, soft water saves you money. Reduced Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes two separately acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and below the very first check valve.</p>
<p>In truth, reverse flow testing developed to make sure that backflow preventers prevent backflow was gotten rid of from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA acknowledges that backflow stays a genuine health concern, it considers preventing it outside the scope of NFPA 25.

After that the softener can be disconnected, transferred to its new area and put there.</p>
