<p>To eliminate the smells, first try putting BioSmart (readily available at WJ McNabb Plumbing) down your drain. You can also attempt 1 cup lemon juice down the drain. After a few minutes, run warm thin down the drain. Insufficient or inaccessible cleanouts: No matter how efficient a drainage system is, it will likely get clogged eventually.

Buildings without adequate cleanout valves, or cleanout valves that can't be easily reached, are at threat of a pipe rupturing.</p>
