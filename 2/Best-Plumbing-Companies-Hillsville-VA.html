<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- destructive. For this reason, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of rust A softener is just capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (typically salt or often potassium).</p>
