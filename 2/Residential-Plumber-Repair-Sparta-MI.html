<p>In some neighborhoods, house water softeners drain to community wastewater treatment plants, which are not developed to eliminate chloride. The chloride travels through the treatment plant and winds up in our streams and lakes. In homes with personal wells and home softeners, chloride drains to the home's septic tank and then winds up in lakes and streams.</p>
