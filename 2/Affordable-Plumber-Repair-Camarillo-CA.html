<p>Have actually utilized Plumb Crazy on three different occasions, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our service technicians and they were great. They quickly discovered the leak and repaired it without making a big mess. They, just like each person we've experienced with Plumb Crazy, were considerate, prompt, and very well-informed. I would recommend Plumb Crazy to anyone needing either small or large job plumbing work.</p>
<p>Longstanding Clogs: Blockages that continue after you've tried to repair them require professional help. Continued attempts by yourself can damage your lines, and you might have a more serious underlying problem than you know. In addition, the longer you delay to require professional help, the higher the probability that you will have sewage back up in your pipes.</p>
