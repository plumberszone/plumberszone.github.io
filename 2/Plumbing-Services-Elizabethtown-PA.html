<p>House owners can practice preventive maintenance to avoid future drainage problems. Once a. month, utilize a plunger in your shower and tub drains to remove any stuck-on debris.

<h3>Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Elizabethtown PA 17022</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months ago. I feel that rates were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March said depending upon the marketplace and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
