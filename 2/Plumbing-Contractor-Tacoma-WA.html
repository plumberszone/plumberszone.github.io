Other materials are susceptible to corrosion and rust while some are untouched. Specific pipe materials have greater coefficients of heat pressure, making them more susceptible to structural tensions and strains as an outcome of temperature level change and ice development.

Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
