<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Bismarck ND 58501</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
