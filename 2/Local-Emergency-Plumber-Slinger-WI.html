<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Slinger WI</h3>

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws initially meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can lead to incorrect drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
