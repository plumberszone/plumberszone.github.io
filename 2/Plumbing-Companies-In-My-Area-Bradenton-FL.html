<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Bradenton FL</h3>
<p>Bought middle ground stainless steel blade design offered at Lowes. Got a little local plumber who overcharged me, I think. $212 with tax for installation only, incl. new $25 strainer for the sink. Approx. 1 hour work for 2 guys.

<p>To replace a gas and repair line expect to pay $ 120 to $1,300. Fixing a gas line is actually replacing a gas line - if it's faulty it needs to be changed. The cost of gas line replacement is determined by the cost of labor and materials. The variation of the cost depends upon whether the job is an easy gas leak repair or a complete replacement of the gas line system. Additional gas line installation for new home appliances are charged independently.</p>
