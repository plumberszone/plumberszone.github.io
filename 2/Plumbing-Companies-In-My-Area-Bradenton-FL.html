<p>To replace a gas and repair line expect to pay $ 120 to $1,300. Fixing a gas line is actually replacing a gas line - if it's faulty it needs to be changed. The cost of gas line replacement is determined by the cost of labor and materials. The variation of the cost depends upon whether the job is an easy gas leak repair or a complete replacement of the gas line system. Additional gas line installation for new home appliances are charged independently.</p>
