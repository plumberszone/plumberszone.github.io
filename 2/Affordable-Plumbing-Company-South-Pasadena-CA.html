More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.

<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely important part of the style of each part. If the component is not fixed appropriately, the guide could limit the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the component, which might trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
