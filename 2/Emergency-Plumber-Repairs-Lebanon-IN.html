<p>The easiest way to keep you and your family safe from the possible risks of backflow through cross connections is to not develop cross connections in the very first location. Nevertheless, if you do have a cross connection to a sprinkler system system, boiler, swimming pool, water feature or other kind of cross connection, have an approved backflow prevention assembly installed.</p>

<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, does not the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does occur more frequently than you believe! Typically it occurs during the night when you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or link a new pipe. This makes construction projects quickly the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another common reason for backflow. Fire engine use huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding communities.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and get rid of water molecules from the solution with firmness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to confess water molecules for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is without firmness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
