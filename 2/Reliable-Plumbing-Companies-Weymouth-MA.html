When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. If permitted to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health threat. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for effectiveness, in addition to checked each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indicator the tank is stopping working and will need to be changed.
