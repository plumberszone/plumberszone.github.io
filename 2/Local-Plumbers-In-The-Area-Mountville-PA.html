<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>

<p>This article aims to address the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes corrosion This is not the case: an effectively configured water softener does not make the cured water more corrosive.
