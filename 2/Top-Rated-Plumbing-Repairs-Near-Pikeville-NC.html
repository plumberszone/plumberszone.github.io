<h3>Recent Advances in Sewer Drain Cleaning Technology at Pikeville NC 27863</h3>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not really the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless for the most part it ought to be much less water.</p>
