<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair at Santa Ana CA 92704</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>We offer upfront rates and accept all forms of payment. We have plumbing installation financing readily available to cover those unanticipated water heating repairs or purchases or to avoid your having to wait to purchase essential plumbing fixtures.
