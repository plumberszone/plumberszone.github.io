<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
