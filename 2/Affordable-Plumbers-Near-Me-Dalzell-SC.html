<h3>Reduce The Cost Of Hiring A Plumber Dalzell SC</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede versus the required direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can become polluted. There is capacity for the contaminated water to end up being a health threat if allowed to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for efficiency, along with inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
